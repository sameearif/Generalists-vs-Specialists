کہیں یہ وہی دو نامعلوم افراد تو نہیں جنہوں نے آئی جی کو اٹھایا.. 😅,1,"The text is considered ""sarcastic"" because it humorously suggests that two ""unknown persons"" might be the same ones who abducted a high-ranking official (implied to be the Inspector General, IG). The context of mentioning ""unknown persons"" in relation to such a serious act as abducting an official, combined with the use of the laughing emoji (😅), indicates a tone of irony or mocking. The irony lies in casually linking everyday unknown individuals with a high-profile criminal act, which is an exaggeration meant to provoke amusement or highlight the absurdity of the situation. Therefore, the presence of humor and exaggeration in a context that would typically be grave confirms the use of sarcasm."
