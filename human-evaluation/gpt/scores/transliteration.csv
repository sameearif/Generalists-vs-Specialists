"The transliterated text provided maintains excellent accuracy in translating the original Urdu text into a phonetically correct Roman Urdu representation. Each word is carefully transliterated, maintaining the correct meaning and phonetics. Capitalization criteria are well met as the names of individuals and countries (e.g., 'Iran', 'Nasir al-Din Qachar') are properly capitalized. Only the year '1850' is numerical and doesn't need capitalization. The phrase structure and word choices remain consistent with standard transliteration practices.",98
"The output transliteration effectively captures the Urdu text in the Roman script with comprehensive accuracy in word conversions. Some minor adjustments in transliteration conventions could be considered, such as 'Nasaar ul-deen Qaqaar' should be more precisely 'Nasir al-Din Qajar' to better reflect common transliteration conventions. Furthermore, 'kuchh baghiaanay soalaat' should perhaps be 'kuch baghiyana sawalat' for accuracy and 'izam' should be 'ilzam' for proper representation of 'الزام'. Despite these minor issues, capitalization is correctly handled with appropriate usage of lowercase for common nouns and mid-sentence words, and uppercase for proper nouns at the beginning like 'Iran', 'Nasaar ul-deen', and 'Qaqaar'. Overall, the transliteration is quite comprehensible and holds true to the source with minor inaccuracies in transliteration standards.",90
"The transliteration of the Urdu text into Roman Urdu is mostly accurate with a few minor discrepancies. The term 'قاچار' is transliterated as 'Qajar', which is a common and correct transliteration reflecting the pronunciation in Persian, but the name 'ناصر الدین' is transliterated as 'Naseruddin', instead of 'Nasiruddin'. However, this difference in transliteration can be considered acceptable as it is close to the pronunciation. The phrase 'پر کچھ' is accurately transliterated as 'per kuchh', maintaining the correct use of 'per' for 'پر'. There is a small issue with the spacing near 'کچھ‍', but it does not significantly affect the overall readability or accuracy. The capitalisation is proper, with proper nouns like 'Iran', 'Naseruddin', and 'Qajar' being capitalized, which aligns with the English transliteration norms. Overall, the transliteration quality is high, with minor issues that do not majorly detract from the text's comprehensibility or correctness.",95
"The transliteration provided is largely accurate in capturing the essence and meaning of the original Urdu text into Roman Urdu. Specific details are: 
1. 'ء' in '1850ء' has been correctly ignored as it merely indicates a reference to a historical date, which is understandable without transliteration. 
2. All other words like 'بغاوت', 'فتنہ', 'پھیلانے', 'خواتین', 'حقوق', 'باغیانہ', 'سوالات', 'الزام', 'ایران', 'بادشاہ', 'ناصر الدین قاچار', 'دربار', and 'بلایا' are transliterated correctly and are comprehensible in Roman Urdu. 
3. The capitalisation is also correctly applied especially for proper nouns like 'Iran', 'Nasaruddin', 'Qachar', reflecting appropriate usage in Roman Urdu. 
The transcribed text maintains the essence and coherence of the original sentence, appropriately transitioning the Urud script to a Romanized version suitable for understanding by Urdu speakers familiar with the Roman alphabet.",98
"The output generally captures the transliteration of the Urdu text quite accurately. However, in the output, 'میلے' is transliterated as 'meelay' instead of 'mele', which slightly alters the sound. The word 'انعقاد' is transliterated as 'ineqad' which should ideally be 'in'iqad' to better represent the pronunciation. The transliteration for 'Sibi mela ka' is very appropriate as it preserves the proper name and related context effectively. The overall transliteration of the sentence is done correctly but minor inconsistencies in pronunciation representation such as in 'meelay' and 'ineqad' had a small impact.",90
"The transliteration output contains some errors and inconsistencies with respect to Urdu spelling mappings and word separations. For instance, the word 'ترین' should be transliterated as 'tareen' instead of 'taraan'. Additionally, the word 'میلہ' in 'سبی میلہ' should be transliterated as 'mela' rather than 'mehlakaa'. There is also an unnecessary hyphen in 'انعقاد', making it 'an-iqaad', which is slightly unusual. Furthermore, compound words and spacing could be better to closely match the original terms.",80
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu appears strong in this output. The words 'دوسرے', 'حصے', 'میں', 'اہم', 'ترین', 'میلے', 'سبی', 'میلہ', 'ہر', 'سال', 'انعقاد', and 'ہوتا ہے' are accurately transliterated as 'doosre', 'hisse', 'mein', 'aham', 'tareen', 'mele', 'sabi', 'milah', 'har', 'saal', 'ineqaad', and 'hota hai', respectively. The transliteration maintains the essence and sound of the original Urdu text. However, there is a slight issue with the transliteration of 'میلہکا' as 'milah ka'. The correct rendering would be closer to 'mela ka', aligning this to mean 'of the fair' without unnecessary breaking or misinterpretation. Yet, given the minor issue, the overall transliteration quality remains high.",95
"The transliteration of the Urdu text into Roman Urdu is mostly accurate, with direct phonetic representations of each word. The words 'دوسرے' (doosre), 'حصے' (hisse), 'میں' (mein), 'اہم' (aham), 'ترین' (tareen), 'میلے' (melee), 'سبی' (sabi), 'میلہ' ('mela'), 'کا' (ka), 'ہر' (har), 'سال' (saal), 'انعقاد' (ineqaad), 'ہوتاہے' (hota hai) match the source consistently. Note that some word spellings like 'میلہکا' in the original text joined 'میلہ' and 'کا', but in the output, these are correctly separated as 'mela ka'. The entire sentence maintains the structure and meaning effectively. Capitalization is not applicable as it is mostly lowercase, which is appropriate for casual text in Roman Urdu.",98
"The transliteration of the Urdu text دینیات کا علم بھی حاصل کیا۔ to 'Deeniyat ka ilm bhi haasil kiya.' is overall accurate. The words 'Deeniyat' (دینیات) which translates to 'theology,' 'ka' (کا) meaning 'of,' 'ilm' (علم) meaning 'knowledge,' 'bhi' (بھی) meaning 'also,' and 'haasil kiya' (حاصل کیا) meaning 'acquired' are correctly transliterated. Each word is properly transliterated keeping in mind the typical variations in rendering Urdu into Roman script. Additionally, the output does not use any capital letters, which is in line with correct transliteration practice for Urdu text as capitalisation in such contexts is not expected. The output provided reflects the input meaning while maintaining appropriate phrase construction in transliteration.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman script in the output is correct for each word. The words include 'deeniat' for 'دینیات', 'ka' for 'کا', 'ilm' for 'علم', 'bhi' for 'بھی', 'hasil' for 'حاصل', and 'kiya' for 'کیا۔'. Each corresponding transliteration correctly reflects the pronunciation of the words. It maintains a consistent transliteration scheme and captures the Urdu sounds accurately in Roman script. Capitalization is not applicable here as the text does not include proper nouns or the start of sentences requiring capitalization in this format.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is accurate. The words 'دینیات', 'علم', 'بھی', 'حاصل', and 'کیا' have been correctly transliterated to 'deeniyat', 'ilm', 'bhi', 'haasil', and 'kiya' respectively. Capitalization is not typically a concern in the transliteration of Urdu text as proper nouns are not indicated with capital letters in Roman Urdu, unlike in English.",100
"The transliteration output accurately captures the Urdu script into Roman Urdu with proper spelling and structure for each word. The words 'دینیات' (diniyat), 'کا' (ka), 'علم' (ilm), 'بھی' (bhi), 'حاصل' (haasil), and 'کیا' (kiya) are all correctly transliterated. The use of lower case throughout the text is appropriate as the original script does not suggest any need for capitalization.",100
"The transliterated text captures the meaning and phonetics of the Urdu text well. The words are correctly transliterated from Urdu to a Roman script for the majority of the phrases. However, there are minor nuances to look at: (1) 'ان کی' is transliterated as 'un ki,' which is an acceptable transliteration. (2) 'تحریر کردہ' is correctly translated as 'tehreer kardah.' (3) 'ذی اثر' is transliterated as 'zee asar,' where 'ذی' typically stands for an attribute and could be transliterated as 'zi e' to match the nasalized sound in Urdu, but 'zee' does evoke the proper sound, so it's acceptable. (4) 'کتاب' is accurately transliterated as 'kitaab.' (5) The book title 'ستیارتھ پرکاش' is written as 'satyarth prakash,' which closely matches the phonetic pronunciation. (6) 'نے' is well transliterated to 'ne,' (7) 'تحریک آزادی ہند میں مدد کی' is also properly transliterated to 'tehreek azadi hind mein madad ki.' There is a consistent and appropriate use of transliteration that maintains the phonetics of Urdu into Roman script. The capitalization is consistent throughout, with no need for use of capital letters as proper nouns followed the source formatting (except for the book title which does not require capitalization in this context). Overall, the transliteration correctly reflects the source language.",95
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu in the output has been done with reasonable accuracy. The phrase 'ان کی ایک تحریر کردہ ذی اثر کتاب', is translated to 'Un ki ek tahreer kar di hui zi'at kitab,' showing a deviation in 'ذی اثر' which has been output as 'zi'at' instead of 'zi asar'. The book title 'ستیارتھ پرکاش' correctly transliterates as 'Satyarth Prakash'. Furthermore, 'تحریک آزادی ہند میں مدد کی' is appropriately transliterated to 'tahrirk azadi hind mein madad ki.' The output could improve by correct transliteration of 'ذی اثر' and a small adjustment in capitalization for proper nouns like 'Satyarth Prakash'. However, the overall flow and major components of the sentence are correctly transliterated, with minor errors in one segment.",85
"The output correctly transliterates the Urdu text into its phonetic English equivalent, maintaining the structure and meaning of the sentence. The transliteration accurately reflects the Urdu words, showing a reasonable phonetic representation of words like 'تحریر' as 'tehreer', 'کردہ' as 'kardah', 'ذی اثر' as 'zi asar', 'ستیارتھ پرکاش' as 'sateyarth prakash', and others. Despite slight readability concerns with the word 'ستیارتھ پرکاش' which could vary in transcription due to its Sanskrit origin, the overall transliteration remains comprehensible and faithful to the original script. Capitalization is consistent with how Urdu is typically transliterated, where capitalization is not applied as it is not common for nouns or proper nouns in running text. Hence, no errors in capitalization are observed.",95
"The transliterated text is generally accurate. Here's a detailed analysis: - 'ان کی' is correctly transliterated as 'un ki'. - 'ایک' is accurately represented as 'aik'. - 'تحریر کردہ' is transliterated as 'tehreer kardah' which closely matches pronunciation. - 'ذی اثر' is transliterated to 'zi asar', aligning well with spoken Urdu. - 'کتاب' matches the common transliteration 'kitaab'. - 'ستیارتھ پرکاش' to 'Satyarath Parkash' although 'Satyarth Prakash' could be another possible representation, the provided one is understandable. - 'نے' is appropriately transliterated as 'ne'. - 'تحریک آزادی ہند' correctly becomes 'tehreek azadi hind'. - 'میں' is correctly translated to 'mein'. - 'مدد کی' is correctly transliterated to 'madad ki'. Capitalization is appropriate with proper nouns like 'Satyarath Parkash'. Overall, this transliteration captures the Urdu text effectively while maintaining the sense and pronunciation features.",98
"The transliteration from Urdu to English provided in the output is largely accurate in terms of converting Urdu words to Roman script. The input sentence 'ترکی سے پیرس چلا گیا جہاں بھارتی انقلابیوں سے اس کی ملاقات ہوئی۔' has been transliterated correctly as 'Turkey se Paris chala gaya jahan Bharati inqalabiyon se is ki mulaqat hui.' with appropriate mappings for each word. However, the word 'بھارتی' which translates contextually as 'Indian' has been transliterated directly as 'Bharati' instead of 'Indian'. The transliteration model authors might have chosen to keep the proper noun as close as possible to the source word. Regarding capitalisation, it seems adjusted and in line where necessary ('Turkey', 'Paris') generally meets the expectations.",90
"The transliteration output is generally accurate and reflects the original Urdu text well. Here's a detailed analysis: 
1. 'ترکی' is transliterated as 'Tarke', which should ideally be 'Turki' to better represent the pronunciation. 
2. 'پیرس', 'چلا گیا', 'جہاں', 'بھارتی', 'انقلابیوں', 'اس', 'کی', 'ملاقات', and 'ہوئی' are accurately transliterated as 'Paris', 'chala gaya', 'jahan', 'Bharati', 'inqilabiyaN', 'us', 'ki', 'mulaqatat', and 'hui' respectively. 
3. The word 'انقلابیوں' has been transliterated to 'inqilabiyaN', which, using the transliteration 'N' at the end, signifies the nasal sound associated with the Urdu 'نون غنہ', which is a subtle nuance captured accurately in the transliteration. 
4. The capitalization is consistently applied throughout the output for proper nouns, like 'Paris' and 'Bharati,' which matches the convention in English for proper nouns.",92
"The transliterated output is accurate. The Urdu phrase 'ترکی سے پیرس چلا گیا جہاں بھارتی انقلابیوں سے اس کی ملاقات ہوئی' is correctly transliterated into 'Turkey se Paris chal gaya jahaan Bhartiya inqelabiyon se us kee mulaqaat hui.' All the key words are appropriately translated, maintaining proper capitalization for 'Turkey' and 'Paris', which are proper nouns, and 'Bhartiya', which is an adjective derived from a proper noun. The transliteration maintains grammatical coherence and is orthographically consistent with common standards used for Urdu to Roman script transliteration. The output properly reflects the input meaning and structure.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is accurate and reflects the original text very precisely. Each word in the output matches the input text correctly in terms of phonetic representation. The words are 'turki' for 'ترکی', 'se' for 'سے', 'paris' for 'پیرس', 'chala gaya' for 'چلا گیا', 'jahan' for 'جہاں', 'bharti' for 'بھارتی', 'inqalabiyon' for 'انقلابیوں', 'se' for 'سے', 'us' for 'اس', 'ki' for 'کی', 'mulaqaat' for 'ملاقات', and 'hui' for 'ہوئی'. Therefore, all words are correct, and there are no errors in the transliteration process. Furthermore, capitalization is maintained correctly according to the conventions of Roman Urdu, where proper nouns such as 'Turki' and 'Paris' should be capitalized. However, the model output has not capitalized 'Turki' and 'Paris', which indicates a minor error in capitalization.",95
"The transliterated text is accurate in terms of reflecting the original Urdu text into Roman Urdu. The proper nouns and general terms are correctly transliterated retaining the meaning: 'Waqar Awan' for 'وقار اعوان', 'column' for 'کالم', 'zyada tar' for 'زیادہ تر', 'halat-e-hazra' for 'حالاتِ حاضرہ', 'siyasiyat' for 'سیاسیات', 'Balochistan' for 'بلوچستان', 'masail' for 'مسائل', and 'bain-ul-mazahib' for 'بین المذاہب'. Additionally, the transliteration correctly represents conjunctions like 'ke' for 'کے' and 'aur' for 'اور', enhancing readability. Capitalisation is also appropriate, with the proper names 'Waqar Awan' and 'Balochistan' starting with capital letters. However, the word 'hum' (ہم) at the end slightly seems out of context possibly due to input truncation. Nevertheless, this does not significantly impact the overall transliteration quality.",98
"The transliteration of the input text into the output has been performed with reasonable accuracy, looking at both word correctness and the minor variation in spelling which is acceptable in transliteration. Key issues noted include minor alterations in spelling like 'Waqaar' instead of 'Waqar' which is more typical, and 'Aewan' instead of 'Awan'. The word 'کالم' is transliterated as 'calom', which should ideally be 'kalam' or 'column'. Transliterations for other words such as 'haalat-e-hazira', 'siyasiyaat', 'Balochistan', 'mas'a'il', and 'beyn al-mazaahib' are quite accurate and represent the common spellings in transliteration. Regarding capitalisation, it is consistently correct across the output.",85
"The output provided fairly accurately transliterates the Urdu text to Roman Urdu. The transliteration of 'وقار اعوان' to 'Waqar Aawan' is slightly incorrect due to the variance in the transliteration of 'آ' - it should ideally be 'Awan' instead of 'Aawan'. The word 'کالم' is accurately transliterated as 'column'. The phrase 'زیادہ تر حالاتِ حاضرہ' is well converted to 'zyada tar halaat haazra', though 'haazra' might be more accurately transliterated as 'hazirah' to reflect the pronunciation but given the variations in Roman Urdu it is acceptable. 'سیاسیات' is rightly changed to 'siyaasiyaat', and 'بلوچستان کے مسائل' is correctly transliterated as 'Balochistan ke masail'. The phrase 'بین المذاہب' is generally well translated as 'bainul mazahib', and 'ہم' is translated simply as 'ham', which is straightforward and correct. Capitalization of proper nouns like 'Waqar Aawan', 'Balochistan' is correctly followed in line with the original script which does not show capitalization differences but can be inferred.",93
"The transliteration provided appears very accurate in terms of the conversion of Urdu text into Roman Urdu. Each word has been correctly transliterated: 'وقار اعوان' to 'Waqar Awan', 'کے' to 'ke', 'کالم' to 'column', 'زیادہ تر' to 'zyada tar', 'حالاتِ حاضرہ' to 'haalaat haazra', 'سیاسیات' to 'siyaasiat', 'بلوچستان' to 'Balochistan', 'کے' to 'ke', 'مسائل' to 'masail', and 'بین المذاہب' to 'bainul mazahib'. The capitalization is also appropriate, with proper nouns like 'Waqar Awan' and 'Balochistan' correctly capitalized. The only minor issue is the inclusion of the word 'hum' at the end, which is not in the original text and can introduce confusion. Considering all factors, the score is slightly reduced due to this extra word.",95
"The transliterated text maintains a high degree of accuracy and appropriateness in its conversion from Urdu script to Roman Urdu. Each word has been converted accurately into an expected transliteration. The sentence structure in the output aligns perfectly with the input. Every word is correctly rendered ('ایک' to 'ek', 'پرانی' to 'purani', 'مسجد' to 'masjid', 'آثار' to 'asar', 'بھی' to 'bhi', 'ہیں' to 'hain', 'جو' to 'jo', 'شہید' to 'shaheed', 'چکی' to 'chuki'). Furthermore, the output respects the overall lowercase usage typically seen in Roman Urdu transliterations, which does not demand capitalization except for proper nouns (not applicable in this sentence).",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is largely accurate, capturing correct representations for the majority of the words. 'ایک' is correctly transliterated to 'ek', 'پرانی' to 'purani', 'مسجد' to 'masjid', 'کے' to 'ke', 'ہیں' to 'hain', 'جو' to 'jo', 'شہید' to 'shahid', and 'ہو چکی' to 'ho chuki'. However, there is a mistake with the word 'آثار' which is transliterated as 'aahra' instead of 'aasaar'. The transliteration captures the pronunciation and sequence correctly except for this one word. Additionally, there is no issue with capitalization as Urdu transliteration does not typically use capital letters except for proper nouns, which are not present in this sentence.",90
"The transliterated output is mostly accurate with regards to the Urdu text. The transliteration of 'ایک' as 'aik', 'پرانی' as 'purani', 'مسجد' as 'masjid', 'کے' as 'ke', 'آثار' as 'aasar', 'بھی' as 'bhi', 'ہیں' as 'hen', 'جو' as 'jo', 'شہید' as 'shaheed', and 'ہو چکی' as 'ho chuki' is correct. The capitalization is appropriate as it handles the proper case for transliteration, where typically all words begin with lowercase in this context, with no proper nouns requiring capital letters.",97
"The translation of the Urdu text to transliterated text has been done very accurately. Each Urdu word has been correctly transformed into its Roman Urdu equivalent: 'ایک' to 'aik', 'پرانی' to 'purani', 'مسجد' to 'masjid', 'کے' to 'ke', 'آثار' to 'aasaar', 'بھی' to 'bhi', 'ہیں' to 'hain', 'جو' to 'jo', 'شہید' to 'shaheed', 'ہو چکی' to 'ho chuki'. The text maintains the integrity of the original message without any change in meaning. Additionally, since the output consists of transliteration into Romanised Urdu, where specific capitalisation rules like capitalising first letters aren't typically applied, the capitalisation here is correctly handled as per the norms of transliteration.",100
"The transliterated text is fairly accurate. Each word is correctly transliterated from Urdu to Roman Urdu. The words 'اس' to 'is', 'نے' to 'ne', 'اٹھا' to 'utha', 'لیا' to 'liya', 'تو' to 'to', 'آپ' to 'aap', 'نے' to 'ne', 'فرمایا' to 'farmaya', 'اب' to 'ab', 'دوسرا' to 'doosra', 'پاؤں' to 'paon', 'بھی' to 'bhi', and 'اٹھاؤ' to 'uthao' all show correct and commonly accepted transliterations. Capitalization rules are observed accurately as Urdu does not use capitalization, and common convention in Roman Urdu transliteration does not necessitate capitals except for proper nouns or beginning of sentences, which is properly handled in the output. However, the usage of simple quotes instead of double quotes in original has been altered to single quotes. While not typically a transliteration issue, it could be minor punctuation adaptation from Urdu typographical conventions to English-based ones. Despite this, it does not affect the transliteration quality directly.",96
"The transliteration from Urdu to English is mostly accurate. The words 'اس', 'نے', 'اٹھا', 'لیا', 'تو', 'آپ', 'نے', 'فرمایا', 'اب', 'دوسرا', 'پاؤں', 'بھی', and 'اٹھاؤ' are correctly transliterated to 'Us', 'ne', 'utha', 'liya', 'to', 'aap', 'ne', 'farmaya', 'Ab', 'dosra', 'paon', 'bhi', and 'uthao' respectively. The translation maintains the integrity of the original Urdu sentence. The only minor issue is the transliteration of 'دوسرا' which could also be accurately transliterated as 'doosra', but 'dosra' is also a commonly accepted variant in transliteration. Proper capitalisation is observed in the transliteration.",98
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman script is accurately done. Each word has been correctly transliterated to the closest phonetic equivalence in English, while maintaining the meaning and context. In Urdu to English transliteration, capitalization rules do not directly apply as they do in original English texts, especially since Urdu script does not use capital letters. The script conversion from Urdu quotation marks to English quotation marks in the text ('’’اب دوسرا پاؤں بھی اٹھاؤ‘‘' to '""ab doosra paon bhi uthao""') is executed correctly, maintaining the integrity of the quoted speech. Considering the nuances in transliteration, which can vary, the output here is very well-rendered.",98
"The transliteration provided is highly accurate. Most of the words like 'اس' to 'is', 'نے' to 'ne', 'اٹھا' to 'utha', 'لیا' to 'liya', and so forth are correctly transliterated from Urdu to Roman Urdu script. The original Urdu script uses formal quotation marks (’’), which are transliterated into English-style double quotes (""), which is acceptable for readability in Roman transliteration. Proper capitalization was also maintained throughout the transliteration as Urdu doesn’t use capitalization.",98
"The transliteration from Urdu to the Latin script is accurately done. The words 'اس شادی میں', 'یسوع مسیح', 'کی', 'شمولیت', 'بیاہ شادی', 'اور', 'ازدواجی زندگی', 'کی', 'پاکیزگی', 'کے بارے میں', 'آپ کی', 'تعلیمات کے', 'عین مطابق' and 'ہے' are all correctly transliterated as 'is shaadi mein', 'Yesu Masih', 'ki', 'shumuliyat', 'biyaah shaadi', 'aur', 'izdawajee zindagi', 'ki', 'paakizgi', 'ke baare mein', 'aap ki', 'taleemaat ke', 'ain mutabiq', and 'hai', respectively. The transliteration reflects appropriate use of Roman Urdu without any significant errors in spelling variations typically observed in transliteration practices. Capitalization is appropriately used at the start of names such as 'Yesu Masih'. The transliteration accurately captures the phonetics and semantics of the original Urdu languge text.",100
"The transliterated text has accurately converted most Urdu words into Roman Urdu with minor discrepancies. Key words like 'شادی', 'یسوع مسیح', 'شمولیت', 'بیاہ', 'ازدواجی', 'زندگی', 'پاکیزگی' and 'تعلیمات' are effectively transliterated into 'shadi', 'Yesu Masih', 'shamooliyat', 'biyah', 'azyaadi', 'zindagi', 'paakizgi', and 'taaleemat'. However, the term 'ازدواجی' is transliterated as 'azyaadi', which is incorrect; the correct transliteration should be 'azdawaji' or 'izdawaji'. All other words are correctly transliterated. Capitalization is uniformly applied to the name 'Yesu Masih' correctly aligning with the requirement for proper noun capitalization in English. The error with 'azdawaji' slightly impacts the overall quality of the transliteration.",90
"The transliterated text represents the Urdu text fairly accurately with minor discrepancies. The words transliterated reflect the sounds of the Urdu text appropriately. The words 'یسوع مسیح' transliterate to 'Yesu Maseeh' which is a common transliteration for the name Jesus Christ in Urdu. Other words like 'شادی' to 'shadi', 'شمولیت' to 'shamooliyat', and 'پاکیزگی' to 'pakizgi' are also accurately represented. However, 'ازدواجی' is transliterated as 'azaadagi' which is incorrect; the correct transliteration should be 'izdawaji'. Moreover, the word 'تعلیمات' has been transliterated as 'taaleemaat' where the correct representation might have been 'taleem' based on common transliteration norms, though an alternative form 'taaleemaat' can be considered acceptable in informal contexts. The capitalization of proper nouns 'Yesu Maseeh' is correctly handled while the rest of the words are in lower case, following usual transliteration norms for consistency in non-proper nouns.",92
"The transliteration of the given Urdu text is overall accurate with only minor errors in the rendition of some words. The phrase 'یسوع مسیح' has been transliterated correctly as 'Yesu masih'. The word 'بیاہ' is transliterated as 'baiha' which is less common but understandable; 'biyah' would be more standard. Similarly, 'پاکیزگی' has been transliterated as 'pakizgi', where the more correct transliteration would be 'paakizgi' to better capture the pronunciation of the original Urdu word. The word 'زندگی' is transliterated appropriately as 'zindagi'. 'تعلیمات' is correctly transliterated as 'taaleemaat' and the phrase 'عین مطابق' as 'ain mutabiq'. There are no capitalization issues since Urdu does not use capitalization and, typically in transliteration, capitalization is applied based on English grammatical rules which are not relevant here.",92
"The transliteration from Urdu to English is quite accurate. Key terms such as 'American Film Institute', 'Chaplin', 'tamam adwar', 'behtareen adakar', and 'qarar diya' are correctly transliterated, maintaining the semantic and phonetic integrity of the original Urdu text. The transliteration of the numerical and temporal reference '1999' and '10wan' is also correctly executed. All words in the output adhere to the standard practices of transliteration without any significant errors in representation. However, proper capitalization rules are not followed for 'American Film Institute' and 'Chaplain,' which should technically be capitalized as proper nouns.",90
"The transliteration contains multiple errors. Firstly, 'امیرکن' is inaccurately transliterated as 'Ameer Khan' instead of 'American'. The word 'فلم انسٹیٹیوٹ' should have been transliterated as 'Film Institute', however, the output correctly transliterates it. For 'چیپلن', the transliteration 'Chaplin' is accurate. 'تمام' is misspelled as 'sabon' instead of 'tamam'. 'ادوار' should be 'adwar', not 'adwar ka'. The number '10' is correctly rendered as '10 waan', though 'واں' in Urdu is usually spelled as 'daswaan' or 'daswan' specifically. 'بہترین اداکار' is transliterated inaccurately as 'bahurin adakaar' instead of 'behtareen adakar'. Lastly, 'قرار دیا' is misspelled as 'qaraam diya' instead of 'qarar diya'. Therefore, the transliteration has significant issues with word accuracy, resulting in a lower score.",40
"The output transliteration is overall coherent but includes several inaccuracies and unconventional spellings. Firstly, 'امیرکن' which should be transliterated as 'American' is rendered as 'amirkun'. The term 'film' is transliterated accurately. 'انسٹیٹیوٹ' is correctly transliterated as 'institute'. 'چیپلن' is appropriately transliterated as 'chaplin', matching common transliteration norms. 'تمام' is transliterated as 'tamam', which is accurate. However, 'ادوار' should ideally be transliterated as 'adwar', and in the output, it is rendered accurately. The number '10' and its suffix 'واں' are combined into '10 wahid', which is incorrect as it should be 'daswan' for tenth. 'بہترین' is transliterated as 'bheestan', which is inaccurate and should be 'behtareen'. 'اداکار' is transliterated as 'adakar', which is reasonably accurate, although it might also appear as 'adakara'. 'قرار دیا' is split into 'qarar diya', which is a reasonable transliteration. In terms of capitalization, there should not be any in this context as proper nouns (like names) are not the subject here, so the lowercase usage here is mostly correct.",65
"The transliteration from Urdu to Romanized text seems accurate. The words 'آمریکن' (American) and 'فلم انسٹیٹیوٹ' (Film Institute) are transliterated as 'Ameerkan' and 'Film Institute', respectively, which are acceptable variations. 'چیپلن' (Chaplin) is also correctly transliterated. Additionally, the numbers and other terms like 'تمام ادوار' (all eras), 'بہترین اداکار' (best actor), and 'قرار دیا' (declared) are accurately converted. Proper capitalisation is maintained for proper nouns. Overall, the transliteration accurately reflects the content and spirit of the Urdu text with correct spelling variations and capitalisation.",97
"The transliterated output is accurate in capturing the Urdu to Latin script transliteration. All words are correctly reflected from the original Urdu script, maintaining proper sounds and syllable structure. The terms such as 'zaroori', 'nahi', 'ke', 'har', 'woh', 'shakhs', 'badshah', 'ho', 'jis', 'ke', 'naam', 'mein', 'shah', and 'ata' are all transliterated correctly and are commonly accepted transliterations for these Urdu words. The sentence structure is retained, and no extra words or meanings are introduced or omitted. The transliteration respects the language norms for such conversion from Urdu to Latin script. Capitalization is not set as a requirement here given the nature of the sentence and the use of lowercase letters throughout is consistent with how such transliterations are usually presented.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is accurate and correctly reflects the phonetics of the original statement. Each word has been accurately transliterated maintaining the integrity of the phrases and meaning. The words 'zaruri', 'nahin', 'ke', 'har', 'woh', 'shakhs', 'badshah', 'ho', 'jis', 'ke', 'naam', 'mein', 'shah', 'aata', 'ho' are all correctly transliterated without any spelling mistakes, reflecting standard transliteration conventions in Roman Urdu. Additionally, capitalization is appropriately handled; as the convention in Roman Urdu transliterations does not require capitalization except for proper nouns or the first word of a sentence which is not applicable here.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to English is accurate overall. Each word is correctly transliterated to represent the phonetic sounds in Urdu. The word 'ضروری' is transliterated as 'zoroori', 'نہیں' as 'nahin', 'کہ' as 'ke', 'ہر' as 'har', 'وہ' as 'woh', 'شخص' as 'shakhs', 'بادشاہ' as 'badshah', 'ہو' as 'ho', 'جس' as 'jis', 'کے' as 'ke', 'نام' as 'naam', 'میں' as 'mein', 'شاہ' as 'Shah', and 'آتا' as 'aata'. The capitalisation of 'Shah' is appropriate as it is used as a proper noun within the context, indicating emphasis typically placed on names or titles.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman script is mostly accurate. The translation of 'ضروری' as 'wajibi' instead of the more common 'zaroori' is a notable deviation. Additionally, the translations of 'نہیں' as 'nahi' rather than 'nahin' and the lack of capitalization for 'har', 'wo', 'shakhs', 'badshah', 'jis', 'ke', 'naam', 'mein', 'shah', and 'aata', which should be capitalized as proper nouns or at the start of the sentence, slightly impact the overall transliteration quality. However, the rest of the transliteration preserves the meaning well.",85
"The transliteration of the input 'عید گاہ مسجد، کاشغر' to 'Eidgah Masjid, Kashghar' is quite accurate. 'عید گاہ' is correctly transliterated as 'Eidgah', 'مسجد' as 'Masjid'. The name 'کاشغر' transliterates well as 'Kashghar', maintaining correct representation and aligning with common English transliterations of the term. Additionally, the separation by a comma follows standard English conventions for listing place names connected to landmarks. Capitalization in the output is used aptly to denote proper nouns.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to English is accurate for most parts. The word 'عید' is correctly transliterated as 'Aid', 'گاہ' as 'Gah', and 'مسجد' as 'Masjid'. The representation of 'کاشغر' as 'Kashghar' properly captures the pronunciation except for slight preferences that might range in representation (like Kashgar). The capitalization of the initial letters in each word is also correct, following English conventions for proper nouns especially in the context of transliterating place names and important cultural sites. Overall, the transliteration maintains accuracy in both the representation of individual words and the application of English capitalization standards.",98
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman script in the output is correct for each word and phrase provided in the input. 'عید گاہ' is correctly transliterated as 'eid gah', 'مسجد' as 'masjid', and 'کاشغر' as 'kashgar'. Additionally, the comma is appropriately placed following the Roman script format for lists or separations, similar to its original use in the Urdu sentence. Capitalization is not needed here since these are not proper nouns except for 'Kashgar' which could be capitalized as it's a location name but capitalization rules can differ in transliterations. Overall, the transliteration is accurate and adheres to general transliteration standards between Urdu and English.",98
"The transliteration from Urdu to English is mostly accurate. 'عید' has been correctly transliterated as 'eid', 'گاہ' as 'gaah', 'مسجد' as 'masjid', and 'کاشغر' as 'kaashgar'. The transliteration captures the pronunciation and the components of the original words accurately. However, the capitalisation is not consistent with standard English practices where proper nouns, especially names of places and religious sites, are typically capitalised. In this output, none of the words are capitalised. 'Eid', 'Gaah', 'Masjid', and 'Kaashgar' should ideally start with capital letters.",80
"The output correctly translates and transliterates the input Urdu text into Roman Urdu while preserving the proper names and general meaning. 'اُس وقت' is accurately transliterated to 'us waqt', meaning 'at that time'. The political parties 'متحدہ قومی موومنٹ' and 'مہاجر قومی موومنٹ' are properly transliterated as 'Mutahidda Qaumi Movement' and 'Muhajir Qaumi Movement', preserving their known English names and capitalizing the words as proper nouns. The phrase 'کہلاتی تھی' is correctly transliterated to 'kehlati thi', indicating past tense 'was called'. All proper nouns are capitalized appropriately.",100
"The transliteration output is fairly accurate with respect to the original Urdu text. However, there are slight nuances that need attention. The term 'متحدہ قومی موومنٹ' is transliterated as 'muttahidda qoumi moument'. While the transliteration of 'متحدہ قومی' as 'muttahidda qoumi' captures the pronunciation well, 'موومنٹ' should ideally be transliterated as 'movement' to better reflect its pronunciation and its origin from the English word 'movement'. The transliteration of 'موومنٹ' as 'moument' slightly distorts the pronunciation. The same issue occurs with 'مہاجر قومی موومنٹ' being transliterated as 'mahajir qoumi moument'. The term 'کہلاتی تھی' is appropriately transliterated as 'kahlaati thi', representing the pronunciation accurately. Overall, the transliteration is good but could be improved by correctly rendering 'موومنٹ' as 'movement' to better align with its pronunciation and English origin.",85
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is mostly accurate, capturing the phonetics of the words well. Let's break down the transliterated text: 
- 'اُس' to 'us' is correct.
- 'وقت' to 'waqt' is correct.
- 'متحدہ' to 'muttahda' captures the phonetics but the more common transliteration is 'mutahida' or 'muthida', hence there's a slight discrepancy in expected spelling.
- 'قومی' to 'qaumi' is correct.
- 'موومنٹ' to 'movement' is correct; here the original Urdu uses the English word 'movement', which is transliterated back to English.
- 'مہاجر' to 'mohajir' is correctly transliterated.
- 'قومی' to 'qaumi' remains consistent and correct. 
- 'کہلاتی' to 'kehlata' should technically end with 'ti' to better represent the feminine verb ending ('کہلاتی' in Urdu), making 'kehlata thi' correct. 
Capitalization is maintained adequately as per the norms in transliteration (capitalizing proper nouns or the start of sentences isn't typically indicated in such transliterations). Overall, except for minor issues with the transliteration of 'متحدہ', the output is quite faithful to the input.",95
"The output text accurately and correctly transliterates the Urdu input into Roman Urdu. The phrases 'متحدہ قومی موومنٹ' and 'مہاجر قومی موومنٹ' are correctly transliterated as 'muttahida qaumi movement' and 'muhaajir qaumi movement' respectively. These are well-known political party names, correctly transliterated preserving their usual representation in Roman script. The other words like 'اُس', 'وقت', 'کہلاتی', and 'تھی' are transliterated as 'us', 'waqt', 'kehlati', and 'thi', which are the standard Roman spellings for these Urdu words. All words are appropriately rendered in lowercase, which is proper for general text transliteration.",100
"The transliterated text maintains excellent accuracy in terms of the Urdu to Roman script conversion for the passage provided. All words are translated correctly, capturing the phonetic essence of Urdu. The transliteration includes terms like 'barre sagheer', 'bohot', 'sheher', 'aise', 'hain', 'jin', 'namon', 'mein', 'kalma', 'naag', and 'shamil hai', which correctly correspond to the original Urdu words in the input text. However, 'برصغیر' is more commonly transliterated as 'Bar-e-Saghir' which slightly deviates from 'barre sagheer'. Despite this, the chosen transliteration 'barre sagheer' is still understandble and fairly common. The transliteration does not use capital letters which is appropriate since Urdu does not have capitalization and the output consistently follows this. Overall, the transliteration effectively communicates the original text in Roman script.",95
"The output contains several transliteration errors and incorrect word representations from Urdu to English. The word 'برصغیر' is incorrectly transliterated as 'Barqadar' instead of 'Bar-e-Saghir'. The word 'بہت' is somewhat correctly transliterated as 'beht', but it is mistakenly merged with 'سے' to form 'behtase' instead of separately as 'bahut se'. The word 'شہر' is correctly transliterated as 'shahar'. The phrase 'ایسے ہیں' should be 'aise hain', but it is written as 'isay hain'. The words 'جن کے ناموں میں' are loosely correct as 'jin ke namon mein'. The term 'کلمہ' is correctly rendered as 'kalmah', and 'ناگ' as 'nag'. Finally, 'شامل ہے' is properly transliterated as 'shamil hai'. The transliteration errors and inconsistency in word separation significantly affect the readability and accuracy of the sentence.",55
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is accurate with a small need to adjust word division. The input phrase 'برصغیر کے بہت سے شہر ایسے ہیں جن کے ناموں میں کلمہ ناگ شامل ہے۔' has been transliterated to 'barre sagheer ke bahut se sheher aise hen jin ke namon mein kalma nag shaamil hai.' Each word is translated correctly, maintaining the meaning of the original text regarding the use of word 'ناگ' in many city names in the subcontinent. However, 'برصغیر' is commonly transliterated as 'bar-e-saghir,' improving readability and reflecting more accurate rendering of Arabic script‐based words into Roman script. No capitalisation errors are present as Urdu doesn’t have capitalisation, and names are kept lower case as needed in transliteration",95
"The transliteration from Urdu to the Roman script is quite accurate and reflects a typical phonetic representation of the words. The terms 'برصغیر' (Bar-Sagheer), 'بہت' (bahut), 'سے' (se), 'شہر' (shahar), 'ایسے' (aise), 'ہیں' (hain), 'جن' (jin), 'کے' (ke), 'ناموں' (naamon), 'میں' (mein), 'کلمہ' (kulma), 'ناگ' (nag), and 'شامل' (shaamil) are all correctly transliterated, maintaining the phonetics of the original Urdu words. The output successfully differentiates each word, preserving the meaning and pronunciation intact. However, it should be noted that 'کلمہ' is better transliterated as 'kalma' instead of 'kulma', but this variant can still be considered acceptable due to variable spelling conventions in transliteration. Capitalization is not applicable as Urdu does not employ capital letters, and the output correctly does not use any capitalization.",95
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is quite accurate in the output provided. 'بیرون ممالک' is correctly transliterated as 'Bairon mulkon', where 'بیرون' means 'foreign' or 'outside' and 'ممالک' refers to 'countries'. The phrase 'میں علامہ اقبال کے پیغام' is appropriately rendered as 'mein Allama Iqbal ke paigham', which translates to 'in Allama Iqbal's message'. Finally, 'کو عام کرنا' is effectively translated as 'ko aam karna', translating to 'to make common' or 'to popularize'. The capitalization in 'Allama Iqbal' is also correctly maintained as it is a proper noun, referring to a person's name. Overall, the transliteration preserves the meanings and spellings without any major errors.",100
"The transliteration of the given Urdu text into Roman Urdu is fairly accurate. However, there are some points to consider for precision: 
1. The word 'بیرون' is transliterated as 'Bayroon' which is correct. 
2. 'ممالک' should be transliterated as 'mamalik'. The output 'mamalkay' uses a phonetic variation which is still understandable, but the more standard spelling would be better. 
3. 'علامہ اقبال' is typically transliterated as 'Allama Iqbal'. The output uses 'Alama' for 'علامہ' which misses an 'l', making it slightly inaccurate. 
4. 'پیغام' is correctly transliterated as 'paygam'. 
5. The capitalization in 'Alama Iqbal' correctly reflects proper naming, albeit with the slightly incorrect transliteration as noted. 
6. The phrase 'میں', 'کے', 'کو', 'عام' and 'کرنا' are correctly transliterated into 'mein', 'kay', 'ko', 'aam', and 'karna' respectively. 
Given these points, the transliteration is mostly effective but has minor errors due to which it doesn’t perfectly match the conventional spellings and one slight capitalization issue.",85
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is mostly accurate with minor inconsistencies. 'بیرون' is transliterated as 'baroon' (a common variant could be 'beroon'), and 'ممالک' as 'mamaalik' (which could also be written as 'mamalik'). 'میں' is correctly transliterated as 'mein', 'علامہ اقبال' accurately as 'Allama Iqbal', 'کے' as 'ke', 'پیغام' as 'paigham', 'کو' as 'ko', 'عام' as 'aam', and 'کرنا' as 'karna'. Capitalization is correctly applied to 'Allama Iqbal', which is a proper noun and should be capitalized. The rest of the transliteration uses appropriate lowercase letters, aligning with general conventions in transliteration for non-proper nouns and other components.",95
"The transliteration of the Urdu text to Roman Urdu is mostly accurate and is reflective of the proper pronunciation. The word 'بیرون' is correctly transliterated as 'beroon', 'ممالک' as 'mamaalik', and 'میں' as 'mein'. The name 'علامہ اقبال' is also appropriately capitalized and transliterated as 'Allama Iqbal', which respects the proper noun status of the name. Furthermore, 'پیغام' is transliterated as 'pegham', 'کو' as 'ko', 'عام' as 'aam', and 'کرنا' as 'karna', all of which are accurately converted. Overall, the transliteration maintains a very high degree of fidelity to the original text and follows Urdu pronunciation closely. Additionally, the capitalization of 'Allama Iqbal' shows proficiency in understanding the need for representing names with capital initials in Roman script.",99
"The transliteration from Urdu to English is well executed with appropriate conversion of each word closely matching conventional transliteration norms. The words are accurately transliterated aligning with typical spellings used in Roman Urdu: 'tha' (تھا), 'chunancha' (چنانچہ), 'us ne' (اس نے), 'shohar' (شوہر), 'se' (سے), 'akhrajaat' (اخراجات), 'aur' (اور), 'nafaqah' (نفقہ), 'hasil' (حاصل), 'karne' (کرنے), 'ke liye' (کے لیے), 'adalat' (عدالت), 'se' (سے), and 'darkhwast' (درخواست). The punctuation, represented by the comma, is also appropriately placed correlating with the Urdu text. Capitalisation is not applicable here as Urdu does not have capital letters and the transliteration follows suit, appropriately using all lower case.",100
"The transliterated output has significant discrepancies from the original text in terms of spelling. The word 'چنانچہ' is transliterated as 'chahancheh' which is correct. However, 'اخراجات' is transliterated as 'ekhrahat' which is incorrect and should be 'akhrajat'. 'نفقہ' is transliterated as 'nafakahasil' which is incorrect and the proper separation should have been 'nafaqa hasil'. Additionally, 'درخواست' is transliterated incorrectly as 'dostrih' instead of 'darkhwast'. On the other hand, the handling of 'عدالت' as 'adalat' is correctly done. The text lacks any notable capitalization requirements, so that issue does not affect the score.",40
"The transliterated text successfully converts all the Urdu words into Roman Urdu with appropriate and common spellings. Each word from the input text is directly converted, maintaining good accuracy in the transliteration. The phrases 'چنانچہ' as 'chunancha', 'شوہر' as 'shauhar', 'اخراجات' as 'ikhrajaat', 'نفقہ' as 'nifaqah', 'حاصل کرنے کے لیے' as 'haasil karne ke liye', 'عدالت سے' as 'adaalat se', and 'درخواست' as 'darkhwast' are correctly transliterated, reflecting the conventional spellings used in Roman Urdu. Additionally, there is correct use of comma after 'tha,' which corresponds properly with the punctuation in the input.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu in the output is very accurate and aligns well with each word's phonetic representation in Urdu. All words are transliterated correctly including 'tha', 'chunancha', 'us ne', 'shohar', 'se', 'ikhrajaat', 'aur', 'nafqa', 'haasil', 'karne', 'ke liye', 'adaalat', 'se', 'darkhwast', and 'ki'. The output maintains the natural flow of the sentence in Roman Urdu without compromising the meaning or sound of the original words. Additionally, the lack of capitalization is appropriate here since the text is in the middle of a sentence. It does not interfere with the representation of the text's meaning or phonetics.",100
"The original text is 'پورٹیج ٹاؤن شپ، ہیوٹن کاؤنٹی، مشی گن'. The transliterated output is 'Portage Town Ship, Houghton County, Michigan'. The transliteration of 'پورٹیج' to 'Portage' is correct as it retains the phonetic sound of the source text. The transliteration of 'ٹاؤن شپ' to 'Town Ship' is almost correct, but in English, it is more commonly spelled as a single word 'Township'. For 'ہیوٹن کاؤنٹی', 'Houghton County' perfectly captures the sound and spelling in English. Similarly, 'مشی گن' is correctly transliterated to 'Michigan', maintaining the phonetic equivalence. The capitalization of initial letters of each name component (Town, Ship, Houghton, County, Michigan) is appropriate for location names in English. The issue of spacing in 'Town Ship' impacts the correctness slightly.",95
"The transliteration from Urdu to English has some accuracy issues. The name 'پورٹیج' is transliterated as 'Portij' which should be 'Portage'. The term 'ٹاؤن شپ' is written as 'Town Ship' instead of the single word 'Township'. Additionally, the name 'ہیوٹن' is transliterated as 'Hyoton' rather than 'Houghton', and 'کاؤنٹی' is written as 'Kauntee' instead of 'County'. The transliteration of 'مشی گن' as 'Meshigan' is close but typically is spelled as 'Michigan'. There is an inconsistency in the treatment of the word 'ٹاؤن شپ', which should form a single word. Capitalization is correct throughout.",50
"The transliteration provided has the following issues: The name 'پورٹیج' was transliterated as 'portage' which is correct. However, 'ٹاؤن شپ' (Township) was split into two separate words 'town ship' when it should be combined as a single word 'township'. The name 'ہیوٹن' (Houghton) is transliterated as 'hawton', which is incorrect phonetically and is a significant error. Lastly, 'مشی گن' is accurately transliterated as 'michigan'. Given the splitting of 'township' and the substantial misspelling of 'Houghton', the overall accuracy is decreased.",65
"In the transliteration from Urdu to English:
1. The word 'پورٹیج' is transliterated as 'portage,' which is accurately transliterated, reflecting the correct pronunciation in English.
2. 'ٹاؤن شپ' is transliterated as 'town ship,' which is a minor error—it should ideally be transliterated as one word 'township' to correctly reflect the American English spelling of the term.
3. 'ہیوٹن کاؤنٹی' is transliterated as 'hutton county.' The correct transliteration for 'ہیوٹن' should be 'houghton,' as it misses the original pronunciation significantly.
4. 'مشی گن' is transliterated as 'michigan,' which is correct.
5. Capitalisation is properly used for all proper nouns which is expected in standard English for place names. However, the transliteration accuracy for 'هیوٹن' significantly lowers the overall quality.",70
"The transliterated output contains several inaccuracies and issues in terms of word correctness. The word 'مختلط' is translated incorrectly as 'mukhtalif' instead of 'mukhtalat'. Similarly, incorrect transliteration of 'روایتاً' which should be 'riwayatan' instead of 'riwayata'. The term 'متغیر' is mistranslated as 'mutaghayyar', when in correct terms it should possibly be 'mutaghayir'. The term 'نظریۂ' is transliterated as 'nazriya' missing the specific context-related suffix, 'theory of' which would better translate to 'nazariya'. 'فنکشن' is transliterated as 'function' which while understood isn't properly Urdu transliterated, better transliteration might be 'fankshan'. 'ریاضیاتی' is properly transliterated as 'riyaziati'. 'اعداد' is incorrect in transliteration 'a'adad' instead of 'adad'. The output maintains consistency in capitalization, as it does not use capitalized words reflecting the source text's lack of capitalization, appropriate in this context given script nature. However, the errors in transliteration of key terms considerably affect the quality of the output.",55
"The output transliteration has several inaccuracies and inconsistencies when compared to the input Urdu text. Firstly, the word 'مختلط' is incorrectly transliterated as 'Mukhtalif' which actually means 'different'; the correct transliteration should be 'Mukhtalit'. The term 'تحلیل' is transliterated as 'ta'neel' which is a phonetic error; it should be 'tahleel'. 'روایتاً' is transliterated as 'rawayatan' which is fairly accurate but the input suggested a more contextual translation like 'istorically' or 'traditionally' would be better. Also, 'متغیر' is transliterated as 'mutaghayir' which is correct. The phrase 'کہلاتا' is transliterated as 'kahlaata', which is accurate. 'ریاضیاتی' is transliterated as 'riyaaziat-i', capturing its adjectival form in Urdu, which is good. 'شاخ' is correctly captured as 'shakh'. The term 'اعداد' should be 'adaad' for 'numbers', not 'aadad'. 'دالہ' is incorrectly transliterated as 'daalay', it should be 'daala'. 'تفتیش' is perfectly transliterated as 'tafteesh'. The overall sentence structure in the output does not significantly alter the meaning from the input, but notable inaccuracies reduce the correctness of the transliteration. Additionally, capitalization in transliteration is generally not an issue here as Urdu script does not have capital letters.",60
"The transliteration output contains several mis-transliterations and errors in word mappings. Here are the detailed breakdowns:
1. ""تحلیل"" is transliterated incorrectly as ""talabli""; the correct transliteration should be closer to ""tahleel"".
2. ""روایتاً"" is somewhat correctly transliterated as ""riwaayatan""; however, the elongation in pronunciation clarity can be disputed as optional.
3. ""متغیر"" is transliterated incorrectly as ""mutaghayyar""; the correct transliteration should be ""mutaghayir"".
4. ""نظریۂ"" is transliterated as ""nazariya"", and ""فنکشن"" as ""function"", both of which are reasonably accurate.
5. ""ریاضیاتی"" is transliterated as ""riyaaziyaati"", which is accurate.
6. ""شاخ"" correctly as ""shaakh"".
7. ""مختلط"", ""اعداد"", ""دالہ"", and ""تفتیش"" are transliterated with minor issues like ""dalah"" instead of ""daala"". Overall, many of the critical terms are mis-transliterated, affecting the understanding of the text.
Capitalisation errors are irrelevant here as Urdu script does not utilize capitalisation.",55
"The transliteration provided contains several inaccuracies and deviations from the source text. The word 'مختلط' has been incorrectly transliterated as 'mukhtalif' instead of 'mukhtalat'. The phrase 'روایتاً مختلط متغیر کا نظریۂ' is partially incorrect; 'روایتاً' is transliterated as 'riwaayatan' which is accurate, but 'مختلط متغیر' again incorrectly appears as 'mukhtalif mutaghayir' instead of 'mukhtalat mutaghayir'. For 'نظریۂ فنکشن', 'nazriyae function' is a reasonable approximation although the exact transliteration of 'نظریۂ' would be 'nazariyah'. Additionally, the word 'فنکشن' phonetically approximates as 'function' but could also be represented more closely to Urdu pronunciation, such as 'fankshan'. The phrase 'ریاضیاتی تحلیل کی شاخ' is largely accurate in transliteration. 'جو مختلط اعداد کے دالہ کی تفتیش کرتا ہے' is translated as 'jo mukhtalif aadad ke dalaal ki tafteesh karta hai' which has several errors: 'مختلط' is again wrongly 'mukhtalif', 'دالہ' should be 'daala' but instead appears as 'dalaal', and 'اعداد' should be 'a'adad'. These errors impact the readability and correctness substantially.",45
"The output appears to be a fairly accurate transliteration from Urdu to Roman script (with use of English orthography). Each word in the input text has been correctly transliterated: 'اس' to 'is', 'کی' to 'ki', 'فصل' to 'fasal', 'نیم' to 'neem', 'بنجر' to 'banjar', 'علاقوں' to 'ilaqon', 'کے' to 'ke', 'ساتھ' to 'saath', 'کم' to 'kam', 'زرخیز' to 'zarkhaiz', 'مٹی،' to 'mitti,', 'کم' (repeated) to 'kam', 'بارش' to 'barish', and 'اور' to 'aur', 'ہے' to 'hai'. There are no capitalization issues since Urdu does not use capitalization, and the Roman script transliteration of informal text like this would not typically involve capitalizing words except for proper nouns or specific style-guided reasons.",100
"The transliteration of the sentence from Urdu to English is mostly accurate, preserving the meaning. The words 'اس کی فصل' correctly transliterated as 'Is ki fasal', 'نیم بنجر' as 'nim banjar', and 'علاقوں' as 'ilaqon'. 'کم زرخیز مٹی' is slightly off; it should be 'kam zarkhaiz mitti' where 'zarkhaiz' is more accurate than 'zara khiz', however, 'zara khiz' is not entirely incorrect because pronunciation can vary, and it somewhat conveys the intended meaning. 'کم بارش' is accurately transliterated as 'kam barish'. The final word 'ہے' is correctly transliterated as 'hai'. Capitalization is appropriate as the output does not require any specific capitalization rules due to the transliteration of a sentence with no proper nouns.",92
"The input text is transliterated correctly into the output. Each Urdu word or phrase is accurately represented in Roman Urdu. There is consistent quality in terms of words' correctness and representation. The phrase 'اس کی فصل' is properly transliterated as 'is ki fasal', 'نیم بنجر علاقوں کے ساتھ' as 'neem banjar ilaqon ke saath', 'کم زرخیز مٹی' as 'kam zarakhiz mitti', 'کم بارش' as 'kam baarish', and 'اور ہے' as 'aur hai'. Without punctuation or special character errors, and with untranslated words accurately reflected in transliterated form, the process maintains a high quality. Capitalization is not required in this context as the transliteration mainly involves lowercase for general usage.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman script is mostly accurate in terms of the phonetic representation of each word. 'اس' is correctly transliterated as 'is', 'کی' as 'ki', 'فصل' as 'fasal', 'نیم' as 'nim', 'بنجر' as 'banjar', 'علاقوں' as 'ilaaqon', 'کے' as 'ke', 'ساتھ' as 'saath', 'کم' as 'kam', 'زرخیز' as 'zarkhez', 'مٹی' as 'mitti', 'کم' as 'kam', 'بارش' as 'barish', and 'ہے' as 'hai'. The capitalization is appropriately non-existent as Urdu script does not differentiate between lower and upper case, and the transliteration here follows the standard practice of using all lower case for Urdu to Roman transliteration. The commas and conjunctions are placed correctly aligning with the natural breaks and linkages in both Urdu and transliterated text.",95
"The transliteration from Urdu to the English script is mostly accurate. The words are correctly transliterated as per their pronunciation and appropriate usage in the Urdu context. The words such as 'ہے' to 'hai', 'کہ' to 'ke', 'اسلام' to 'Islam', 'برداشت' to 'bardasht' are correct. Other words like 'متعلق' to 'mutaliq', 'پیغام' to 'paigham', 'روح' to 'rooh', 'ناواقف' to 'nawaaqif', 'مغربی' to 'maghrabi', and 'دنیا' to 'dunya' are also correctly transliterated. The text maintains consistent capitalization appropriate for transliteration context, using capital letters for proper nouns like 'Islam'. All words are transliterated in a way that their pronunciation is appropriately represented, and the transition between the words is smooth without losing the essence of the original Urdu text.",98
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is mostly correct and consistent with the phonetic representation of the Urdu words. However, there are minor issues in the transliteration: 
1. 'ہے' should be transliterated as 'hai' instead of 'Hay'. Similarly, 'کہ' should be 'ke' instead of 'kahi' to reflect the more common usage.
2. 'پیغام' is transliterated as 'pyam,' which is missing the 'gha' part, making it more correct as 'paigham'.
3. The term 'ناواقف' is transliterated as 'naa-aqif', which slightly misses the standard 'na-waaqif'.
4. The rest of the transliteration such as 'اسلام', 'برداشت', 'متعلق', 'کی', 'روح', 'مغربی', 'دنیا', 'کے' are correctly transliterated as 'Islam', 'bardasht', 'mutaliq', 'ki', 'rooh', 'maghribi', 'dunya', and 'ke'.
The capitalization is appropriately handled since Roman Urdu generally does not use capitalization except for proper nouns. Here the only necessary capitalization is for 'Islam', which is correctly capitalized in accordance to Urdu and English usage of proper nouns.",85
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is accurate and well-executed in the provided text. Words such as 'ہے', 'کہ', 'اسلام', 'کے', 'برداشت', 'سے', 'متعلق', 'پیغام', 'کو', 'کی', 'روح', 'ناواقف', 'مغربی', 'دنیا', have been converted correctly to 'he', 'ke', 'islam', 'ke', 'bardaasht', 'se', 'mutaaliq', 'pehgam', 'ko', 'ki', 'rooh', 'naawaqif', 'maghribi', 'dunya'. Each transliterated word correctly reflects its Urdu counterpart, capturing the phonetics accurately. The transliteration maintains the essence of the original language, and phrases are resumed aptly without mixing parts incorrectly. Capitalization issues are typically not relevant here as Urdu script does not have a concept of capitalization. However, appropriate capitalization could be considered for proper nouns, though in this transliteration, there are none that require it. Based on these observations, the transliteration is of high quality.",98
"The transliterated output accurately converts the Urdu text into Roman Urdu. All words are transliterated correctly keeping in mind the pronunciation in Urdu. The transliterations include 'hai' for 'ہے', 'ke' for 'کہ', 'islam' for 'اسلام', 'bardasht' for 'برداشت', 'se' for 'سے', 'mutaalliq' (adding an extra 'l' for emphasis) for 'متعلق', 'paighaam' for 'پیغام', 'ko' for 'کو', 'ki' for 'کی', 'rooh' for 'روح', 'se' repeated correctly, 'naa waqif' for 'ناواقف', 'maghribi' for 'مغربی', and 'duniya' for 'دنیا'. Furthermore, although capitalization does not generally apply in Urdu and the traditional Roman Urdu does not mandate capitalizing specific words, the capitalization of nouns or specific terms as in English can be observed here in the name 'Islam'. However, as per typical Roman Urdu usage, capitalization is not expected to begin each word that might otherwise be capitalized in an English context, such as the first word of the sentence. The transliteration is precise and conveys the message without loss of contextual meaning or phonetic inaccuracies.",98
"The output accurately transliterates the Urdu phrases into English. The phrase 'اس کے بعد' is correctly transliterated to 'is ke baad', 'پرنسٹن یونیورسٹی' to 'Princeton University', and 'امریکا چلے گئے' to 'America chale gaye'. Each component of the sentence has been correctly rendered in terms of spelling. Furthermore, the capitalisation of proper nouns 'Princeton', 'University', and 'America' is appropriate, aligning with English language norms for the capitalisation of place names and institutional names. Hence, both the correctness of words and the proper capitalisation are achieved in the output.",100
"The transliteration of the Urdu text to the Roman script is overall very accurate. The words 'اس' ('Us'), 'کے بعد' ('ke baad'), and 'چلے گئے' ('chale gaye') are correctly transliterated. The names 'پرنسٹن یونیورسٹی' ('Princeton University') and 'امریکا' ('America') are also properly transliterated and maintain standard spellings. Additionally, the proper nouns 'Princeton', 'University', and 'America' are appropriately capitalized. Hence, the transliteration job is done very well.",100
"The transliteration is mostly accurate. The phrase 'اس کے بعد' is correctly transliterated as 'is ke baad'. The name 'پرنسٹن یونیورسٹی' is accurately rendered as 'prinston university', although the typical English spelling is 'Princeton'. The decision to use 'prinston' indicates a literal transliteration approach. The term 'امریکا' is transliterated as 'america', aligning with common English usage but it ideally should be capitalized to 'America'. The phrase 'چلے گئے' is correctly transliterated into 'chale gaye'. The distinction between upper and lower case in proper nouns ('university' and 'america') should have been observing capitalization.",85
"The output transliteration has done a fair job, but there are a few inaccuracies. The correct transliteration for 'پرنسٹن' should be 'Princeton' but has been written as 'Princen', which indicates a spelling error. Other words such as 'اس' to 'is', 'کے' to 'ke', 'بعد' to 'baad', 'یونیورسٹی' to 'University', 'امریکا' to 'America', 'چلے گئے' to 'chale gaye' are accurately transliterated, including proper capitalization of proper nouns like 'University' and 'America'.",85
"The provided output effectively captures the transliteration of the input Urdu text into Roman Urdu. Here's a detailed breakdown: 1. 'وہ' is correctly transliterated as 'woh', 2. 'درگا' is transliterated as 'darga', although 'daraga' could also be used, so slight flexibility in pronunciation is acceptable, 3. 'تک' correctly appears as 'tak', 4. 'چلتا ہے' is accurately rendered to 'chalta hai', 5. 'اور' is perfectly transliterated to 'aur', 6. 'بخشش' is mapped to 'bakhshish', which is standard, 7. 'کے لیے' translates well to 'ke liye', 8. 'اسے' to 'usay', and 9. 'بھرا کرتا ہے' is translated as 'bhara karta hai', capturing the essence of the phrase. Capitalization is consistent with the norms of Roman Urdu where typically all words start with lowercase unless they are proper nouns or begin a sentence. Overall, there is precise transliteration of each word with appropriate spelling choices and accurate grammatical rendering.",95
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is well executed. The word 'وہ' is correctly transliterated as 'Who' which, while not a direct transliteration ('woh'), captures the colloquial or commonly accepted form in Roman Urdu. 'درگا' is transliterated as 'dar-gah' which correctly captures the pronunciation, but the more appropriate transliteration considering standard spelling in Roman Urdu would be 'dargah'. 'تک' as 'tak', 'چلتا' as 'chalta', 'ہے' as 'hai', 'اور' as 'aur', 'بخشش' as 'bakhshish', and 'کے لیے' as 'ke lie' are all accurately done. The phrase 'اسے بھرا کرتا ہے۔' transliterated as 'isay bhara karta hai' is overall correct, but 'bhara' could suggest a slight deviation in understanding the context or meaning of the original text if not carefully interpreted. The capitalization is correctly not applied, as that aligns with the general conventions of Roman Urdu which does not typically use capital letters except for proper nouns or the beginning of sentences. Overall, except for the slight slip in 'dar-gah' and possible nuanced loss in 'bhara', the transliteration is very accurate.",95
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman script appears fairly accurate in terms of phonetic representation, adhering well to the sounds of the words. The words 'وہ' (wo), 'درگا' (durga), 'تک' (tak), 'چلتا' (chalta), 'ہے' (he), 'اور' (aur), 'بخشش' (bakhshish), 'کے' (ke), 'لیے' (liye), 'اسے' (use), and 'بھرا کرتا ہے' (bhara karta he) are transliterated correctly. Both occurrences of 'ہے' have been transliterated as 'he', which maintains consistency. However, there are minor issues related with proper capitalization. All transliterated text is in lowercase, ignoring the requirement for capitalization at the beginning of the sentence and for the proper noun 'Durga'.",93
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu in the output is accurate with each word correctly transferring phonetic sounds. 'وہ' is properly transliterated as 'wo', 'درگا' as 'darga', 'تک' as 'tak', 'چلتا ہے' as 'chalta hai', 'اور' as 'aur', 'بخشش' as 'bakhshish', 'کے لیے' as 'ke liye', 'اسے' as 'use', and 'بھرا کرتا ہے' as 'bhara karta hai'. The transliteration maintains the structure and meaning of the original sentence without any errors. The capitalization in Roman Urdu isn't typically significant as it would be in English, so the output is appropriate as all words are in lowercase, reflecting standard practice in such contexts.",100
"The output text successfully captures the translation from the Urdu input to Roman Urdu. Each Urdu word is correctly transliterated to the corresponding Roman form. The words 'عقائد', 'اور', 'تاریخی', 'شواہد', 'کے', 'مطابق', 'سنہ', 'ہجری', 'بمطابق', 'عیسوی', 'میں', 'حضرت', 'امام', 'حسن', 'عسکری' are correctly translated to 'aqaaid', 'aur', 'tareekhi', 'shawahid', 'ke', 'mutabiq', 'sanah', 'hijri', 'bemutabiq', 'eesvi', 'mein', 'Hazrat', 'Imam', 'Hassan', 'Askari' respectively. Capitalisation is mostly correct. However, the name 'Hazrat Imam Hassan Askari' has inconsistent capitalization (only the first letters should be capitalized within a name). Nonetheless, overall it is well-translated.",95
"The transliteration of the text has maintained mostly accurate spelling though there are some minor errors. The use of 'Aqaaid' instead of 'Aqaid' for 'عقائد' is acceptable, but it is worth noting that 'Aqaid' might be more common. 'shawaahid' could also be transliterated as 'shawahid'. 'senh' is an inaccurate transliteration for 'سنہ'; it should be 'sanah' or 'sannah'. 'hijri', 'isvi', 'bematbaq' are well transliterated although 'bematbaq' could also be 'bi-mutabiq'. 'Huzrat' for 'حضرت' should ideally be 'Hazrat', and 'Imam' and 'Hasan Askari' are correctly transliterated. Capitalization is handled correctly with proper nouns capitalized appropriately (Huzrat, Imam, Hasan Askari).",85
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman script is mostly correct in terms of phonetic accuracy, while minor deviation from standard transliteration practices is noted. The words 'عقائد', 'تاریخی', 'شواہد', 'مطابق', 'سنہ', 'ہجری', 'بمطابق', 'عیسوی', 'میں', 'حضرت', 'امام', 'حسن', 'عسکری' have been correctly transliterated as 'aqaayid', 'taareekhi', 'shawaahid', 'mutaabiq', 'san', 'hijri', 'bamaataabiq', 'AD', 'mein', 'Hazrat', 'Imam', 'Hassan', and 'Askari'. However, the capitalization for 'Hazrat Imam Hassan Askari', 'AD' is incorrect as 'AD' should be 'CE' for consistency with the common era dating system. The number '874AD' should have been written as '874 CE', correlating better with the non-Islamic calendar use. Additionally, 'san' should be capitalized as 'San' while stating both the Hijri and CE years since they are proper nouns in this context.",92
"The transliteration mapping from Urdu to English is well done. Words like 'عقائد' to 'aqaid', 'تاریخی' to 'tareekhi', 'شواہد' to 'shoahad', 'مطابق' to 'mutabiq', 'سنہ' to 'san', and 'حضرت امام حسن عسکری' to 'hazrat imam hasan askari' are accurately transliterated reflecting the appropriate sounds in Urdu. However, the word 'بمطابق' is split in the output as 'ba mutabiq', which is acceptable as it enhances readability. Numerals and bracket use are correctly maintained. Capitalization is consistent throughout the transliteration, which is ideal as proper nouns and the beginning of the sentence do not require capitalization in transliteration context.",98
"The transliteration output is mostly accurate both in terms of word accuracy and capitalization. Every element from Urdu to Roman Urdu is well captured, including the transliteration of 'بائبل' to 'Bible' which is an acceptable form as it relates to the commonly used name in English contexts. 'کے عربی ترجمہ میں' is correctly transliterated as 'ke arabi tarjuma mein,' and 'اس کتاب کو' as 'is kitaab ko.' The phrase 'الاویین ( لاوی کی جمع )' is properly transliterated as 'Alaviyeen (Lawi ki jama)', considering the name transliteration and the parenthesis content indicating a form of explanation. Similarly, 'اور انگریزی ترجمہ میں' accurately becomes 'aur angrezi tarjuma mein.' Additionally, proper nouns such as 'Alaviyeen' and starting of sentences are correctly capitalized, aligning with the transliteration standards.",100
"The transliterated text matches the input Urdu text accurately in terms of word correctness. All words from the Urdu input have been correctly transliterated into their Roman Urdu counterparts, demonstrating both a correct understanding and application of transliteration rules for these words. The phrases 'Baibl ke Aarabi tarjamah mein', 'is kitab ko Alawein', 'Laavi ki jam', and 'aur Ingriizi tarjamah mein' are accurately transliterated conserving the meaning and phonetic representation from the original. Capitalization is correctly applied for the proper nouns and titles, e.g., 'Baibl', 'Aarabi', 'Alawein', 'Laavi', and 'Ingriizi'.",100
"The transliteration from the Urdu text to the Roman script seems accurate, capturing each word with a consistent and understandable transliteration scheme. The transliteration of 'بائبل' to 'bible' captures the pronunciation correctly, albeit using the English word directly. 'کے عربی ترجمہ میں' is accurately transformed to 'ke arabic tarjuma main', matching general transliteration practices. 'اس کتاب کو' to 'us kitab ko' maintains the correct meaning and phonetic structure. 'الاویین ( لاوی کی جمع )' to 'alauween (lavi ki jama)' aptly transcribes the specific terminology, correctly noting the parenthetical explanation for clarity. 'اور انگریزی ترجمہ میں' is also well transliterated to 'aur angrezi tarjuma main'. In terms of capitalization, it follows a uniform lowercase style common in transliteration of Urdu to roman script, which is acceptable since the original script does not contain capitalization.",98
"The transliteration from Urdu to English is mostly accurate with some errors. 1. The transliteration of 'بائبل' to 'bible' should ideally be 'Bible' to maintain proper capitalization. 2. The word 'الاویین' is transliterated as 'al-waseen', which is incorrect; the correct transliteration should be 'al-awiyin' or closer variations to represent the correct pronunciation. Other words like 'عربی', 'ترجمہ', 'کتاب', 'لاوی', 'جمع', and 'انگریزی' are well-transliterated as 'arabi', 'tarjuma', 'kitaab', 'lawi', 'jama', and 'angrezi'. Capitalization and specific transliteration of 'الاویین' impact the accuracy of the overall text.",80
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is accurate and correctly reflects the original text. The words 'Jawan afrad mein is ki lambai 16 se 20 inch tak hoti hai' are correctly transformed from the Urdu script 'جوان افراد میں اس کی لمبائی 16 سے 20انچ تک ہوتی ہے', with appropriate use of numerals and English word 'inch' for 'انچ'. Each Urdu word is represented in Roman Urdu, and the capitalisation is appropriately used for the beginning of the sentence.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu in the given output is mostly accurate, but there are a few points to consider. The term 'افراد' is transliterated as 'aadmiyn' which is generally used to mean 'people' or 'persons' but seems like an interpretation rather than a direct transliteration; the direct transliteration should ideally be 'afrād'. The output used 'jabawān' as 'jawān', which is a direct transliteration for 'young' or 'youth', and this is correct. The transliteration of 'لمبائی' as 'lamba'i', 'ہوتی ہے' as 'hoti hai', and the numbers '16 سے 20 انچ' as '16 se 20 inch' are appropriately transformed, maintaining correct usage of numbers and units, and direct spelling. However, there should be attentive consideration given to the word 'اس' being transliterated as 'us', which, although contextually makes sense, can impact the score slightly since the focus is on transliteration, not translation. There is no issue with capitalization since output in Roman Urdu is generally in lowercase for body text, aligning with standard practices.",85
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is almost accurate with an appropriate conversion of words and numbers. The words 'جوان افراد' are correctly transliterated as 'jawan afraad', 'میں' as 'mein', 'اس کی' as 'is ki', 'لمبائی' as 'lambai', 'سے' as 'se', 'تک' as 'tak', and 'ہوتی ہے' as 'hoti hai'. All these transliterations are commonly accepted forms in Roman Urdu. The numbers '16' and '20' along with the word 'انچ' (inches) are correctly represented in the output with the correct English numeral format and unit. The transliteration is coherent, maintains the meaning of the original sentence, and the conversion of measurements is accurate. Moreover, the use of capitalization is appropriately minimal as expected in continuous Urdu text. Since the transliterated text effectively and accurately represents the original Urdu sentence, the score is high.",98
"The transliterated output accurately represents the Urdu input. All words are correctly transliterated from 'جوان' to 'jawan', 'افراد' to 'afraad', 'میں' to 'mein', 'اس' to 'is', 'کی' to 'ki', 'لمبائی' to 'lambai', 'سے' to 'se', 'تک' to 'tak', and 'ہوتی ہے' to 'hoti hai'. Moreover, the numbers '16' and '20' along with the unit 'انچ' to 'inch' are correctly retained and formatted. There are no capitalization issues since the transliteration is performed in all lowercase consistently with correct spacing.",100
"The transliterated text is accurate in converting the Urdu script to Roman Urdu. Each word 'یہ' to 'yeh,' 'مملکت' to 'mamlikat,' 'اسرائیل' to 'israel,' 'کا' to 'ka,' 'دار الحکومت' to 'dar ul hukoomat,' and 'تھا' to 'tha' is correctly translated and reflects proper usage in common transliteration practices. The transliteration maintains phonetic integrity and readability for Urdu speakers familiar with Roman script. Additionally, capitalization is correctly not applied as per Urdu-to-Roman transliteration norms where capitalization is only used for proper nouns or at the beginning of sentences, which is not relevant in this context.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to English in the output is mostly accurate with minor issues. The input 'یہ مملکت اسرائیل کا دار الحکومت تھا۔' translates to 'This was the capital of the State of Israel.' The word 'مملکت' has been transliterated as 'mulk' which generally means 'country' in Urdu, while 'مملکت' is more correctly translated as 'state' or 'kingdom'. Though 'mulk' and 'mumlikat' have close meanings, they are not interchangeable in this specific context. The transliteration of all other words such as 'یہ' to 'Yeh', 'اسرائیل' to 'Israae'l', 'کا' to 'ka', 'دار الحکومت' to 'dar al-hukumat', and 'تھا' to 'tha' are done correctly. Additionally, the output maintains proper capitalization for 'Israae'l' as required.",85
"The transliteration from Urdu to Romanized Urdu is quite accurate. The words are correctly represented in Roman script as follows: 'یہ' transliterated to 'ye', 'مملکت' to 'mamlikat', 'اسرائیل' to 'Israel', 'کا' to 'ka', 'دار الحکومت' to 'daarul hukumat', and 'تھا' to 'tha'. Each of these translations are consistent with standard transliteration practices from Urdu to Roman Urdu. Also, capitalization is appropriately used for the proper noun 'Israel', while the other non-proper nouns are in lowercase, which aligns with the standard writing conventions in Roman Urdu.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu in the given output is almost accurate and adheres to standard transliteration norms for Urdu phrases. The transliterated text 'ye mamlakat Israel ka darul hukumat tha.' correctly reflects the original Urdu text 'یہ مملکت اسرائیل کا دار الحکومت تھا۔' with proper conversion of each word including proper nouns. The word 'Israel' is a proper noun and is correctly capitalized. Overall, word-by-word translation and capitalization are correctly handled, hence a high score is justified.",98
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is accurate. Each word has been correctly transliterated maintaining the phonetic essence of Urdu. 'جب' to 'jab', 'انسان' to 'insaan', 'بیت الخلا' to 'baitul khala', 'جاتا ہے' to 'jata hai', 'تو' to 'to', 'بسم اللہ' to 'bismillah', 'کہے' to 'kahe', 'یہ' to 'yeh', 'اس' to 'us', 'کی' to 'ki', 'شرمگاہ' to 'sharmgah', 'اور' to 'aur', 'جن' to 'jin', 'کی' repeated as 'ki', 'آنکھوں' to 'aankhon', 'کے' to 'ke', 'درمیان' to 'darmiyan', 'پردہ' to 'parda', 'ہو گا' to 'ho ga' are all correctly transliterated. Capitalization conventions in Urdu transliteration typically do not require capital letters except for proper nouns, which are not present here. Therefore, the capitalization is also appropriate.",100
"The transliterated text from Urdu to Urdu in Roman script accurately follows the accurate phonetic mapping between the two scripts. The output successfully converts each Urdu word into its corresponding Roman Urdu form, maintaining the integrity and meaning of the original text. Additionally, the use of hyphenation in 'bayt-e-khala' and correct phrase translations like 'bismillah kahay' also complement the readability in Roman Urdu. The phrase 'aur jun ki aankhon ke darmiyan' faithfully represents the original script's intent, illustrating the consistent use of conjunctions and prepositions. Capitalization is appropriately used for the first word of the sentence, aligning with proper sentence structuring in Roman Urdu. Overall, the transliteration is of high quality.",98
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is mostly accurate in terms of letter-to-letter representation and the specific terms used. All special words like 'بیت الخلا', 'بسم اللہ', 'شرمگاہ', and 'جن' etc. are correctly transliterated ('baytul khala', 'bismillah', 'sharamgaah', 'jin'). There are minor discrepancies, such as 'انسان' should ideally be transliterated as 'insaan' instead of 'ensaan'. The word 'پردہ' has been transliterated as 'parde' which should preferably be 'pardah' for more precise phonetic accuracy. Also, transliteration of 'کہے' as 'kee' is incorrect and should be 'keh'. Capitalization is consistent and appropriate, aligning with the norms of Urdu transliteration into Roman script where names and first words of sentences are not typically capitalized unless they begin the sentence. In this specific text snippet, none of the words require capitalization according to these rules.",85
"The transliteration of the Urdu text into the Latin alphabet is accurate. The transliterated words 'jab insaan baitul khala jaata hai to basmullah kahe ye us ki sharmagha aur jin ki aankhon ke darmiyan parda ho ga' match their Urdu counterparts well in phonetics and spelling nuances. However, the transliteration for 'بسم اللہ' as 'basmullah' is slightly incorrect; the more accepted form is 'bismillah'. Also, capitalisation in transliterated text should ideally represent proper nouns or beginnings of sentences, which is missing here ('jab', 'basmullah', and 'ye' should have been capitalized if trying to mimic proper English punctuation standards). Therefore, the score is slightly reduced.",85
"The transliterated text mostly accurately reflects the original Urdu input into Roman Urdu. The word 'یہ' is correctly transliterated as 'ye', 'ضرورت' as 'zaroorat', 'اس بنا پر' as 'is bina par', 'اور' as 'aur', 'بڑھ گئی' as 'barh gayi', 'تھی' as 'thi', 'کہ' as 'ke', 'ایران' as 'Iran', and 'ساسانی سلطنت' as 'Sasanian Sultanat'. The direct transliteration of 'کے ساتھ' as 'ke sath' accurately represents the Urdu phrase meaning 'with'. However, the transliteration 'روم' as 'Room' is incorrect and should be 'Rome' to properly represent the historical empire in context. Additionally, the capitalization is appropriate for proper nouns 'Iran' and 'Sasanian Sultanat' as per English standards, though there's an inconsistency with the capitalization of 'Roman' (should be capital 'R' but is spelled 'Room').",90
"The output covers all the words from the input successfully; however, there are some transliteration and spelling errors. 1. 'بنا' is transliterated as 'bunyad', which is not very conventional. The more correct form would be 'bunaa'. 2. 'بڑھ' is transliterated as 'bard'. A more accurate transliteration would be 'barh.' 3. 'ساسانی' is transliterated as 'Sasaani', but the more accepted transliteration would be 'Sassani.' 4. 'روم' is transliterated as 'Roome', adding an extra 'e' which is unnecessary. The correct rendition would be 'Rome.' The capitalization following the rules of English for proper nouns such as 'Iran', and 'Sasaani' is accurately done.",80
"The transliteration of the Urdu text into Roman Urdu is mostly accurate, maintaining the semantic consistency and correct spelling. Key considerations include the transcription of the words 'ضرورت' as 'zaroorat', 'بنا' as 'bina', 'پر' as 'par', 'بڑھ' as 'badh', 'گئی' as 'gayi', 'تھی' as 'thi', 'کہ' as 'ke', 'ایران' as 'Iran', 'ساسانی' as 'Sasani', 'سلطنت' as 'saltanat', 'ساتھ' as 'saath', and 'روم' as 'Rome'. However, there are some minor issues with the consistency in transliteration like the use of 'kee' for 'کی' instead of 'ki', and the missing capitalization of 'Iran', 'Sasani', and 'Rome'. Interestingly, proper nouns in transliterated text should be capitalized.",90
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is mostly correct with accurate representation of most words. The transliteration for 'ضرورت' to 'zaroorat', 'اس بنا پر' to 'is bina par', 'اور بڑھ گئی' to 'aur badh gayi', 'تھی' to 'thi', 'کہ' to 'ke', 'ساسانی' to 'Sasani', and 'سلطنت' to 'saltanat' are correct. However, there is an issue with capitalization. The word 'ایران' which refers to the country name 'Iran' is correctly capitalized, but 'روم' which refers to 'Rome' is transliterated as 'Room' instead of 'Rome,' and it also should be capitalized as 'Rome'. The minor mistakes in transliteration ('kee' instead of 'ki' and 'Room' instead of 'Rome') do not substantially hinder the readability or understanding but are inaccuracies that need consideration.",85
"The transliterated output closely matches the Urdu input, with proper transliteration of Urdu words into Latin script. Key words like 'انتہائی', 'ذہن', 'عمدہ', 'معاشرت', 'عالی', 'مرتبہ', 'کتابوں', 'مطالعہ', 'ہمیشہ', 'مشغول', 'رہنے', 'والے', 'یکجا', 'کرنے', 'دلداہ' and 'تھے' have been accurately rendered as 'intehai', 'zehan', 'umdah', 'muashart', 'aali', 'martaba', 'kitabon', 'mutala'a', 'hamesha', 'mashghool', 'rehne', 'walay', 'yakja', 'karne', 'dildad' and 'they', respectively. The transliteration also maintains the integrity of the sentence's meaning without any omissions. Capitalization is consistent and appropriate for transliterated Urdu into English, with all words beginning in lowercase as this segment does not contain any proper nouns or start of a sentence warrants capitalization.",98
"The transliteration of the given Urdu text into Roman Urdu script is fairly accurate with a few minor discrepancies in spelling transliteration. The word for 'ذہن' is transliterated as 'zhan' instead of 'zehn' which is the more typical spelling. Additionally, the transliteration of 'عالی مرتبہ' as 'alimarat' slightly merges the words and misses the accurate representation which should be closer to 'aali martabah'. Furthermore, 'مطالعہ' is represented as 'mutalia' instead of 'mutaala', and 'ہمیشہ' as 'mehsham' seems like a typing error, should be 'hamesha'. The transliteration also misses the terminal double 'e' sound in 'rehne', spelling it as 'rehny'. The term 'یکجا' transliterated as 'yikja' should preferably be spelled as 'ikja'. Capitalization is generally avoided in transliterated text but aligns with Urdu's non-use of capital letters. Overall, the transliteration captures the majority of the text accurately, with small spelling errors.",78
"The transliteration from Urdu script to Latin script here has been largely accurate. Each word from Urdu has been converted in a way that retains most of the phonetic characteristics of the originals in Urdu. Proper nouns are not present, thus capitalization is not relevant in this context. The transliteration adheres closely to the commonly accepted representations of these Urdu words in the Latin script.

Words like 'انتہائی' (intehayi), 'ذہن' (zehan), 'عمدہ' (umda), 'معاشرت' (muashrat), 'عالی' (aali), 'مرتبہ' (martaba), 'کتابوں' (kitabon), 'مطالعہ' (mutalaa), 'ہمیشہ' (hamesha), 'مشغول' (mashghool), 'رہنے' (rahne), 'والے' (waale), 'یکجا' (yakja), 'کرنے' (karne), 'دلداہ' (dil daah) and 'تھے' (the) are transliterated effectively representing the words correctly according to common transliteration standards.",98
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is mostly accurate and maintains the semantics and phonetics of the original text. Each word is correctly transliterated reflecting appropriate phonetic renderings such as 'intehayi' for 'انتہائی', 'zehen' for 'ذہن', 'umda' for 'عمدہ', 'muashrat' for 'معاشرت', and 'aala martaba' for 'عالی مرتبہ'. 'Kitaabon ke mutaala' correctly captures 'کتابوں کے مطالعہ', and the phrase 'hamesha mashghool rahne waale' perfectly mirrors 'ہمیشہ مشغول رہنے والے'. The transliteration of 'yakja karne ke daldaa the' also correctly captures the phrase 'یکجا کرنے کے دلداہ تھے'. Furthermore, as per the given criteria, capitalization is not a factor in this text as proper nouns are not apparent, and common practice in transliterated Urdu tends to not use capitalization unless indicating proper nouns explicitly or beginning of sentences. Hence, no capitalisation Issue in this output.",98
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman script has a few issues. First, the word 'افریقی' is transliterated as 'Afrqi' instead of 'Afriqi', missing an 'i' in the transliteration. This slightly affects the pronunciation and recognition of the word. The words 'نظموں', 'تراجم', and 'مشتمل' are transliterated as 'nazmon', 'tarajum', and 'mushtamil' respectively, which are reasonably accurate, maintaining the meaning and sound of the original words. The word 'مجموعہ' is correctly transliterated as 'majmua'. Lastly, the word 'کالا' is transliterated accurately as 'Kala', and 'پینڈا' as 'Pinda'. The capitalization is appropriate as the phrase starts with a capitalized word 'Afrqi' and the phrase 'Kala Pinda' also starts with capital letters. However, the incorrect transliteration of 'افریقی' slightly lowers the score.",85
"The transliteration of the given Urdu text into Roman Urdu has a few inaccuracies. The transliteration of 'نظموں' as 'nazmoon' is correct in a broader sense for understanding, yet a precise transliteration would be 'nazmon'. The word 'مشتمل' is inaccurately transliterated as 'moshlam' which should be 'mushtamil' for an accurate representation. The transliteration of 'مجموعہ' as 'majmooa' is quite acceptable and commonly used, though for pure phonetic equivalence, 'majmu'ah' could be considered. 'کالا پینڈا' is transliterated accurately in terms of pronunciation to 'Kala Pindah', though the exact transliteration would be closer to 'Kala Panda'. The overall structure complies well with Urdu transliteration norms, but specific inaccuracies affect the score.",70
"The transliterated output captures most of the Urdu words with acceptable precision, although there are minor inconsistencies in transliteration. 'نظموں' is correctly transliterated as 'nazmon'. 'تراجم' is rendered as 'tarajim', which is also accurate. 'مشتمل' is transformed to 'mushtamil', maintaining the meaning correctly. The phrase 'مجموعہ کالا پینڈا' is given as 'majmua kala pand' where 'مجموعہ' is correctly represented as 'majmua', and 'کالا' accurately appears as 'kala'. However, 'پینڈا' misses its last character in transliteration, being shortened to 'pand'. The overall transliteration corresponds clearly to the original text but shows minor fidelity issues primarily at the ending of the last word. Additionally, the output lacks capitalization for proper nouns, which is expected in transliteration to denote specificity, especially when transliterating from languages like Urdu to English. Here, terms like 'African' could ideally be capitalized to signify its importance as demonyms usually are in English.",87
"The transliteration of the given Urdu text to Roman script is mostly accurate, but there are slight discrepancies in the spelling and transliteration of certain words. 'افریقی' is transliterated as 'Africi' which is generally understood but the more accurate transliteration would be 'Afrīqī'. 'نظموں' is appropriately transliterated as 'nazmon', and 'تراجم' as 'taraajm' matches standard practices. 'مشتمل' is transliterated as 'mushtamil' which could ideally be 'mushtamil'. 'مجموعہ' is correctly transliterated as 'majmua'. 'کالا پینڈا' is transliterated as 'Kala Panda', which is mostly accurate, though transliteration styles may vary slightly. Capitalisation is properly applied especially to 'Kala Panda' as per general practices of capitalizing proper nouns in transliteration.",92
"The transliteration of the input 'صلاح الدین طوفانی' to 'Salahuddin Toofani' is correctly done. The names are properly transliterated maintaining the phonetic integrity of Urdu into English. 'صلاح الدین' is accurately transliterated as 'Salahuddin' and 'طوفانی' as 'Toofany', where 'Toofany' has been adapted to 'Toofani' which is a common spelling variation in English transliteration adjusting to pronunciation practices. Therefore, the spelling is appropriate, and nothing seems incorrect. Additionally, capitalization conventions in English are adhered to with the first letters of both names being capitalized.",100
"The transliteration of 'صلاح الدین' to 'Salahuddin' and 'طوفانی' to 'Toofani' is accurate and reflects proper spelling of these words in English, preserving the phonetics effectively. The capitalization of the first letters of each name is also correct, maintaining proper English language conventions.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to English of 'صلاح الدین طوفانی' as 'Salahuddin Tufani' is quite accurate. The name 'صلاح الدین' has been correctly transliterated to 'Salahuddin' which is a common spelling for this name, reflecting proper handling of the individual parts of the name including the correct representation of 'الدین' as 'uddin'. The word 'طوفانی' has been transliterated to 'Tufani', maintaining the meaning and phonetic components of the word which suggests 'stormy' or 'like a storm'. The transliteration captures the original sounds and meanings effectively without any errors in spelling or capitalization. Both words are properly capitalized as names typically would be in English.",100
"The transliterated output 'Salahuddin Tofani' from the Urdu input 'صلاح الدین طوفانی' is quite accurate. The name 'صلاح الدین' has been correctly transliterated into 'Salahuddin' which retains the original pronunciation and meaning of the name. Similarly, 'طوفانی' is correctly transliterated into 'Tofani', matching the phonetic pronunciation of the word. Capitalization is also properly utilized, with the first letters of each name capitalized, adhering to the norms of proper nouns in English.",95
"The transliteration of the Urdu input into Roman Urdu is fairly accurate. Each word is correctly transliterated and closely matches common transliteration practices. The terms 'مطابق' is transliterated as 'mutabiq', 'حملہ' as 'hamla', 'کرتے ہیں' as 'karte hain', 'جبکہ' as 'jabkeh', 'مخالف' as 'mukhalif', 'فریق' as 'fariq', 'جسم' as 'jism', 'مختلف' as 'mukhtalif', 'حصوں' as 'hisson', 'لگنے' as 'lagnay', 'پوائنس' as 'points', and 'ملتے ہیں' as 'milte hain'. These are all correct per common transliteration standards. Capitalisation is not typically used in Urdu and carrying this over to transliterated text is optional and context dependent, but not having it does not impact readability or understanding. Therefore, it is fine in this context. The term 'پوائنس' transliterated as 'points' refers to a transliteration into English which might seem incorrect, but it can be seen as acceptable given that it represents a commonly Kromanized form of the English word 'points' used in Urdu contexts.",95
"The transliteration provided contains multiple errors in transliteration which affect the understanding of the original Urdu text. The phrase 'مطابق' is wrongly transliterated as 'Mataaib' instead of 'Mutabiq', which changed the meaning of the phrase. Moreover, 'فریق' is wrongly transliterated as 'farigh' which means 'free' or 'idle' in Urdu instead of 'farieq' which means 'party' or 'side'. Also, the word 'حصوں' is transliterated as 'hasoon,' which is incorrect and should be 'hisaon'. The transliteration of 'پوائنٹس' as 'poo'ayn' is incorrect; it should be closer to 'points'. The errors in transliteration significantly hinder the readability and meaning of the text.",40
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is mostly accurate keeping the meaning and phonetics intact. The words 'مطابق', 'حملہ', 'کرتے ہیں', 'جبکہ', 'مخالف', 'فریق', 'جسم', 'پر', 'مختلف', 'حصوں', 'لگنے', 'مختلف', 'پوائنس', 'ملتے ہیں' are correctly transliterated as 'mutaabiq', 'hamla', 'karte hain', 'jabkay', 'mukhalif', 'fariq', 'jism', 'par', 'mukhtalif', 'hisson', 'lagne', 'mukhtalif', 'poince', 'milte hain'. However, the word 'پوائنس' should be transliterated as 'points' instead of 'poince' to correctly reflect its pronunciation and proper spelling in English context.",95
"The transliterated text accurately represents the Urdu input with proper usage of corresponding transliterated words, demonstrating accurate phonetic representations. However, in Urdu, the word for 'points' is 'پوائنٹس' which was transliterated as 'point' when it should ideally have been 'points' to accurately reflect the plural nature in English transliteration. Additionally, modern transliteration conventions suggest the use of diacritics or additional markers to represent specific sounds. No capitalization issues are observed, as capitalization is not a feature required in Urdu to English transliteration.",95
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu in the output is quite accurate. All words are correctly transliterated with minor variances typical of transliteration where exact matches aren't always possible but close phonetics are maintained. For example, 'بعد' to 'baad', 'یہ' to 'yeh', and 'اصطلاح' to 'istilah'. Similarly, the transliteration for 'اداروں کے انتظام' as 'idaron ke intizam' and 'نظریہ' as 'nazriya' are well done. The phrase 'خاص طور پر آن لائن تنظیموں' is correctly translated as 'khaas tor par online tanzeemon', capturing both the specific terminology and the proper noun 'online'. The concluding part 'میں کثرت سے استعمال ہوئی' is well-translated into 'mein kasrat se istemal hui.' The capitalization is consistent throughout the text as the convention in Urdu to English transliteration typically does not involve capitalizing common nouns or adjectives, which is correctly not done here. The transliteration effectively communicates the original text in Roman Urdu without any critical errors.",98
"The transliteration of the provided Urdu text into Roman Urdu is mostly accurate. The transliteration for 'بعد' as 'Ba'd', 'یہ' as 'yeh', 'اصطلاح' as 'ishtirah', 'اداروں' as 'adaron', 'کے' as 'ke', 'انتظام' as 'intizam', 'نظریہ' as 'nazriyah', 'خاص طور پر' as 'khass tor par', 'آن لائن' as 'an lain', 'تنظیموں' as 'tanziyo'n', 'میں' as 'mein', 'کثرت سے' as 'kathrat se', and 'استعمال ہوئی' as 'istamal huee' is generally correct. The word 'آن لائن' is especially well transliterated as 'an lain' followed by 'online' which enhances clarity. However, there are slight deviations: 'اصطلاح' is more conventionally transliterated as 'istilah' instead of 'ishtirah', and 'تنظیموں' can be transliterated more conventionally as 'tanzeemon' rather than 'tanziyo'n'. The transliteration should avoid constructs that are non-uniform like 'tanziyo'n', which might confuse readers. Additionally, the apostrophe in 'Ba'd' for 'بعد' may not be necessary and might be confusing. The capitalization is appropriate as all proper nouns and the first word of the sentence start with a capital letter, which aligns well with the transliteration rules.",85
"The provided transliteration from Urdu to a romanized form maintains a high degree of accuracy in conveying the Urdu text phonetically in Roman script. The words 'بعد', 'یہ', 'اصطلاح', 'اداروں', 'کے', 'انتظام', 'کے', 'نظریہ', 'خاص طور پر', 'آن لائن', 'تنظیموں', 'میں', 'کثرت', 'سے', and 'استعمال ہوئی' are transliterated as 'baad', 'ye', 'istilaah', 'idaaron', 'ke', 'intizam', 'ke', 'nazaria', 'khas taur par', 'online', 'tanzeemon', 'mein', 'kasrat', 'se', and 'istemaal hui', respectively, which precisely match their phonetic sounds in Urdu. Capitalization is correctly not applied as none of the words in the original text are proper nouns or begin a sentence within the bracket which would require capitalization.",100
"The output accurately reflects the input text's Urdu content in Roman Urdu with a very high accuracy. All of the words from the Urdu input have been correctly transliterated into Roman Urdu, maintaining the proper equivalents for the respective words. Phrases like 'کے انتظام کے نظریہ', 'آن لائن تنظیموں', and 'کثرت سے استعمال' have been correctly converted as 'ke intezaam ke nazriya', 'online tanzeemon', and 'kasrat se istemaal'. The transliteration includes the appropriate representation of terms and respects the context, including the parenthetical remark that is also carried over correctly ('(khaas taur par online tanzeemon)'). The transliteration model has handled Urdu sounds well and represented them into Roman characters effectively. Even subtle sound differences are well captured. Additionally, the capitalization rule is appropriately followed as the output doesn't need any specific capitalization for the given text style and content.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to English appears largely correct, preserving the meanings of the words correctly: 'تاۃم' to 'Taham', 'اس نے' to 'us ne', 'ٹریمپ' to 'Trump', 'لباس' to 'libas', 'چند پہلے' to 'chand pehlay', 'بننے والی' to 'bannay wali', 'فلم' to 'film', and 'کے لیے' to 'ke liye'. However, the film's title 'میبلز سٹرینج پریڈیکیمینٹ' is transliterated as 'Mebels Strange Predicament', where 'میبلز' should be 'Mabel's' to align pronunciation more closely with English norms and maintain the possessive form which seems more linguistically appropriate given Urdu script. Additionally, the word 'وضع' is transliterated as 'waza', a possible transcription error where 'تیار کیا' or 'ترتیب دیا' correlates more explicitly to setting or creating something in this context, making ‘waza kiya’ somewhat ambiguous.",85
"The transliteration of the Urdu text into Latin script has several inaccuracies and discrepancies, affecting the overall correctness and usability of the transliterated output. Errors in word transliteration such as 'ٹریمپ' to 'tramip' instead of 'Trump,' confusion in 'میبلز' transliterated as 'meeblez' instead of closer to 'Meebles,' and other such variations like 'چند' to 'chand' affect the recognizability of words. Additional mistakes are found with words like 'پریڈیکیمینٹ' being transliterated as 'preedikimain' which somewhat maintains phonetical elements, yet strays in preciseness. Moreover, words like 'وضع' are inaccurately captured as 'wazah' rather than more accurately 'vazah'. There are no capitalisations relevant to the context such as proper nouns which should have been capitalised ('Trump', 'Meebles', 'Strange Predicament'). Overall, these problems significantly reduce the quality and effectiveness of the transliteration.",40
"Almost all words in the output are closely matching with the correct Urdu to English transliteration except some minor inaccuracies. The word 'ٹریمپ' is transliterated as 'tremp' rather than the more accurate 'Trump.' Furthermore, the titles 'میبلز سٹرینج پریڈیکیمنٹ' are transliterated as 'mebbles strange predeciment' which can be considered fairly, but not exactly accurate. Capitalization is not applicable as Urdu script does not use capital letters, and the use of lower case in transliteration follows general English norms for sentence case. Overall, although there are slight inaccuracies, the transliteration grasps the phonetic essence of the Urdu script well.",85
"The transliteration output closely follows the input Urdu text with mostly accurate phonetic representations. However, there are some inconsistencies and errors. The word 'ٹریمپ' should be transliterated to 'Trump' to maintain proper noun accuracy, but it is transliterated as 'tramp' which can mislead with a different English word. The movie title 'میبلز سٹرینج پریڈیکیمینٹ' is transliterated as 'marbles staring production', which significantly deviates from the likely intended transliteration 'Mabel's Strange Predicament'. This alters the meaning and reference completely. Minor errors like 'وضع' transliterated as 'waza' instead of the more accurate 'wozu' and 'libas' (clothes) which might sometimes be transliterated with 'lubas' for closer phonetic accuracy. Considering these deviations and the preservation of some correct transliterations, the score reflects a balance of these factors.",50
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman script is accurately done overall. The word 'یہاں' is correctly transliterated to 'Yahan', 'ان کی' as 'un ki', 'پہلی' as 'pehli', 'فلم' as 'film', and 'تھی' as 'thi'. The phrase ’دال میں کالا‘ is correctly transliterated as 'Daal Mein Kala'. The phrase is properly encapsulated in single quotes in the output, maintaining the format from the input. There are no issues with capitalization, as Urdu does not employ capital letters and the standard practice in transliterating Urdu to English does not inherently require any in this sentence.",100
"The transliteration provided is fairly accurate with some minor discrepancies. The word 'یہاں' is transliterated as 'Yehaan', which might be acceptable but typically it is more accurate as 'Yahan'. The word 'ان' is accurately transliterated as 'un'. The phrase 'پہلی فلم' is transliterated as 'pehli film', which is correct. The title 'دال میں کالا' is transliterated as 'Dall mein Kala'. Here, 'دال' should ideally be transliterated as 'Daal' instead of 'Dall' for more precision. The capitalization within the phrase 'Dall mein Kala' is done adequately, with 'Kala' being capitalized correctly to denote the title of a film. The final word 'تھی' is accurately captured as 'thi'. Furthermore, as written Urdu does not use capital letters, capitalization here pertains to proper nouns and titles, which is executed appropriately except for 'mein' which should be in lowercase.",85
"The transliteration from Urdu to English is quite precise. The transliterated text 'yahaan un kee pahli film daal mein kaala thi.' corresponds well with the Urdu input 'یہاں ان کی پہلی فلم ’دال میں کالا‘ تھی۔'. Each word is appropriately converted, maintaining the phonetic sounds from the original Urdu: 'یہاں' to 'yahaan', 'ان' to 'un', 'کی' to 'kee', 'پہلی' to 'pahli', 'فلم' to 'film', 'دال' to 'daal', 'میں' to 'mein', 'کالا' to 'kaala', and 'تھی' to 'thi'. The transliteration also considers the soft and hard sounds in Urdu, like converting 'کی' to 'kee' and 'کالا' to 'kaala' which reflects the pronunciation accurately. Capitalization is not relevant here as Urdu script does not use capital letters and the transliteration is consistent in using all lowercase, which is typical for transliterated text.",100
"The transliteration of the given Urdu text into the Roman script is accurate and maintains the integrity of the phrases. Each word from the Urdu text has been accurately transliterated, with phrases like 'یہاں' translated as 'yahaan', 'ان کی' as 'un ki', 'پہلی' as 'pehli', 'فلم' as 'film', 'دال میں کالا' as 'dal mein kala', and 'تھی' as 'thi'. The phrase within the quotation marks in the input has been correctly captured and transliterated. Additionally, there are no issues with capitalization as Urdu doesn’t employ capital letters. Thus, all criteria for high-quality transliteration are met.",100
"The transliteration of the Urdu text 'نئے کردار ہیں ہم لوگ اگلی داستانوں کے' into Latin script is 'Naye kirdaar hain hum log agli dastaanon ke'. This transliteration is highly accurate. Each Urdu word has been correctly and clearly converted into its Roman Urdu equivalent. The words 'نئے', 'کردار', 'ہیں', 'ہم', 'لوگ', 'اگلی', 'داستانوں', and 'کے' are correctly translated to 'Naye', 'kirdaar', 'hain', 'hum', 'log', 'agli', 'dastaanon', and 'ke' respectively. The transliteration appropriately handles the elongation represented by 'وں' in 'داستانوں' to 'oon' in 'dastaanon', which is a common practice in transliteration to capture nuances in Urdu pronunciation. However, the word 'نئے' can alternatively be transliterated as 'naye' or 'nay', both are accepted; the chosen 'naye' here is correct and conveys the right sound. Capitalization is correct and uniformly applied across the transliteration, keeping proper nouns and regular words in lowercase as suitable in typical sentence structure in both English and transliteration contexts.",100
"The transliterated text captures the sound of most words from Urdu to Roman script quite well, but has some errors in the transliteration. Here's a breakdown: 'نئے' should be transliterated as 'naye' and not 'Nayy', the diacritical representation of 'ی' in نئے as 'yy' is incorrect. Also, 'اگلی' should be transliterated to 'agli' instead of 'aghlee', as there is an unnecessary elongation and misrepresentation of 'گ'. These errors impact the correctness of the transliteration. Capitalization is consistently lowercase, which is typical for transliteration and not an error in this context.",70
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman script is done accurately. The words 'نئے', 'کردار', 'ہیں', 'ہم', 'لوگ', 'اگلی', 'داستانوں', and 'کے' are correctly transliterated as 'naye', 'kirdaar', 'hain', 'ham', 'log', 'agli', 'daastanon', and 'ke'. The capitalisation is also correct as the text in transliteration generally does not require capitalization unless it's the beginning of a sentence or a proper noun, which does not apply here.",100
"The transliterated output captures the original Urdu text precisely and correctly translates each word into the romanized form. 'نئے' is accurately transliterated as 'naye', 'کردار' as 'kirdaar', 'ہیں' as 'hain', 'ہم' as 'hum', 'لوگ' as 'log', 'اگلی' as 'agli', 'داستانوں' as 'dastanon', and 'کے' as 'ke'. The transliteration respects the grammar and sequence of words in the original sentence and each transliterated word is true to the phonetic of the original words, including the appropriate transliteration of the extended 'o' sound in 'log'. Capitalization is handled uniformly in lowercase letters, which is consistent throughout.",100
"The transliterated text accurately converts the Urdu text into a Romanized form, maintaining correct spellings and proper capitalization of proper nouns and the start of sentences. The names 'آغا افتخار حسین' are properly transliterated as 'Agha Iftikhar Hussain', respecting the individual name conventions. The date '17 اپریل، 1921ء' has been accurately transliterated to '17 April, 1921'. The location 'دہلی، برطانوی ہندوستان' is correctly given as 'Delhi, British Hindustan'. The phrase 'میں پیدا ہوئے' is rendered as 'mein paida huye', capturing both grammar and context appropriately.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu appears accurate in terms of spelling and represents the original meaning effectively. The names 'آغا افتخار حسین' are correctly transliterated as 'Agha Iftikhar Hussain', and the other words are consistent with standard transliteration conventions. The date and names of places ('17 اپریل، 1921ء', 'دہلی', and 'برطانوی ہندوستان') are appropriately transliterated as '17 April, 1921', 'Delhi', and 'British Hindustan'. The phrase 'پیدا ہوئے' is correctly transcribed as 'paida huey'. All components are correct with proper capitalization where needed, matching the expected format for proper noun capitalization in English.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to the Roman script is accurate in this example. Each Urdu name and term has been properly transliterated into the closest phonetic equivalent in English. 'آغا' is transliterated as 'Agha', 'افتخار' as 'Iftekhar', and 'حسین' as 'Hussain', which are common transliterations for these names. The date and place details like '17 اپریل، 1921ء' to '17 April, 1921', and 'دہلی، برطانوی ہندوستان' to 'Delhi, Bartanvi Hindostan' are also correct and appropriately formatted with capitalization. The phrase 'کو ... میں پیدا ہوئے' is accurately rendered as 'ko ... mein paida huwe.', maintaining the correct structure and capitalization.",100
"The transliteration of the Urdu text into Roman Urdu is relatively accurate. The words 'آغا' (Aagha), 'افتخار' (Iftekhar), 'حسین' (Husain), 'اپریل' (April), 'دہلی' (Dehli), 'برطانوی' (Bartanvi), 'ہندوستان' (Hindostan), 'پیدا' (Paida), and 'ہوئے' (Huye) are correctly transliterated in terms of phonetic representation. The date '17 اپریل، 1921ء' is also accurately transliterated as '17 April, 1921'. The overall sentence structure in terms of transliteration is correctly maintained. However, the word 'دہلی' should ideally be transliterated as 'Delhi' to match its more commonly accepted English representation. Despite this, the given transliteration 'Dehli' is a phonetically plausible rendering.",95
"The transliterated text accurately represents the original Urdu text in Roman script. Each Urdu word is correctly transliterated to its closest phonetic equivalent in Roman script, and the sentence structure is maintained. The transliteration of words like 'اتنا' to 'itna', 'بے وقوف' to 'bewaqoof', 'ہے' to 'hai', among others, showcases proper understanding of Urdu pronunciation when written in Roman script. The use of capitalization for 'Hasna' is appropriate as it is a proper noun, referring to a person's name. There are no spelling or capitalization errors in the provided output.",100
"The transliterated output contains several discrepancies from an accurate transliteration. Firstly, 'اتنا' should be transliterated as 'itna' not 'Atana'. 'بے وقوف' is incorrectly rendered as 'be wufaah' whereas it should be 'bewaqoof'. The term 'محبوبہ' is mistaken as 'muhabbaah', which should be 'mehbooba'. Additionally, the transliteration of 'حسنا' as 'husnaa' introduces an unnecessary long vowel, and it should be simply 'hasna'. Moreover, each word's accuracy in using long vowels 'aa' at times instead of single 'a' is inconsistent. Also, the output misses proper capitalization according to English conventions (e.g., proper nouns), though this isn't clear in the context what should be fully capitalized beyond typical start of the sentence. These inaccuracies influence the error in delivering a faithful and understandable transliteration.",55
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is accurate with respect to the spelling and usage of corresponding sounds in Roman script for the given Urdu words. The input phrase is correctly transliterated word-for-word. The terms 'اپنی محبوبہ حسنا' are correctly rendered as 'apni mahbooha husna', correctly maintaining the context and components of the original sentence. No capitalization is required here since the sentence does not contain any proper nouns that would typically be capitalized in Urdu, and the first word does not require capitalization in transliteration to the Roman script in this context.",100
"The transliteration of the provided text from Urdu to Roman Urdu appears to be accurate overall. Each word is correctly translated according to common transliteration practices. Specific points include: 1) 'اتنا' is correctly transliterated to 'itna', 2) 'بے وقوف' to 'be waquf', reflecting the usual informal transliteration, 3) 'ہے' to 'hai', 'کہ' to 'ke', 'ایک' to 'aik', 'مقام' to 'muqaam', 'اپنی' to 'apni', 'محبوبہ' to 'mahbooba', 'حسنا' to 'husna', 'کو' to 'ko', 'قتل' to 'qatl', 'کرنا' to 'karna', 'چاہتا' to 'chahta'. Each transition from script to Roman script retains the phonetic essence of the original Urdu words. There is no use of capital letters, which is correct given that the text is a sentence not involving proper nouns needing capitalization (apart from 'حسنا' transliterated as 'husna', which could optionally be capitalized as a name but is acceptable in lowercase). The conversion maintains the integrity of the Urdu language phonetically and structurally.",98
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is quite accurate. The word transliterations such as 'اس' to 'is', 'دوران' to 'doraan', 'میں' to 'mein', 'بولیور' to 'Bolivar', 'کو' to 'ko', 'پانچ' to 'paanch', 'بار' to 'bar', 'وطن' to 'watan', 'چھوڑنا' to 'chhodna', and 'پڑا' to 'parha' are correctly rendered with appropriate spelling for each word in Roman Urdu, preserving the phonetics and meaning. The capitalization of 'Bolivar' is appropriate as it is a proper noun referring to a person's name. The overall text is readable and accurately represents the original Urdu text.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is almost correct with each word closely matching its phonetic pronunciation in Urdu. The word 'بولیور' is transliterated as 'boleevur', which approximates the sound of the original name though it could be argued that 'Bolivar' is a recognizable transliteration adapting to its commonly known spelling. The name potrays Simon Bolivar, therefore, a more fitting transcription might be 'Bolivar' instead of 'boleevur'. The capitalization follows general Urdu to Roman Urdu transliteration practices where only proper nouns should be capitalized; however, the output lacks proper capitalization of the proper noun 'Boleevur/Bolivar', which is not capitalized. Overall, the transliteration is mostly accurate but improvement is needed for proper nouns.",88
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman script in the output is mostly accurate with some minor discrepancies. The correct transliteration for 'بولیور' should be 'Bolívar' considering it's a proper noun referring to a known figure, but it is transliterated as 'boliyar' which can cause confusion regarding the identity. However, the rest of the sentence ('اس دوران میں ... کو پانچ بار وطن چھوڑنا پڑا۔') is accurately transliterated as 'is dauraan mein ... ko paanch baar watan chhodna pada.' The spelling, continuity, and representation of other words are correct, maintaining the integrity of the original text. Proper capitalisation for the rest of the text is appropriately used reflecting a lowercase utilization for general words, which is acceptable in romanization of Urdu sentences.",85
"The transliteration of the given Urdu text into Roman Urdu is mostly accurate with some exceptions. The original text 'بولیور' has been transliterated as 'boor', which is incorrect. The correct transliteration should be 'bolivar', implying the name 'Bolívar'. All other words ('اس دوران میں' as 'is dauraan mein', 'پانچ بار' as 'paanch baar', 'وطن' as 'watan', 'چھوڑنا' as 'chhodna', 'پڑا' as 'pada') are correctly transliterated. The capitalization criterion is not relevant here as the Roman Urdu output does not typically employ capitalization. However, the significant error in transliterating the name 'بولیور' impacts the quality of the translation.",75
"The transliteration of the Urdu text is done accurately except for minor deviation in the transliteration of 'ماحول' which should be 'mahaul' instead of 'mahol'. The correctness of words is very high and the capitalization is appropriately maintained with no capital letters used, matching the context of the original non-capitalized script in Urdu.",98
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is generally accurate in terms of spelling, maintaining a consistent mapping from Urdu script to Roman alphabet. The words 'اس نظریے', 'کے مطابق', 'حیاتی اجسام', 'اپنی بقا کے لیے', 'خود کو', 'ماحول', 'کے مطابق', 'تبدیل کر لیتے', and 'ہیں' are correctly transliterated as 'is nazariye', 'ke mutaabiq', 'hayati jism', 'apni baqa ke liye', 'khud ko', 'maa-hool', 'ke mutaabiq', 'tabdeel kar letay', and 'hain' respectively. However, there are two minor areas where improvements can be made: The word 'حیاتی اجسام' could also be transliterated as 'hayati ajsam' to reflect plural more closely. The word 'ماحول' has been transliterated as 'maa-hool,' which, although phonetically correct, would usually be written as 'mahol' in Roman Urdu for simplicity and closer alignment to frequent usage patterns. The capitalization is consistent and aligns well with the guidelines for such transliterations, maintaining lowercase throughout as typically no capitalization rules apply in such contexts.",95
"The transliterated text is mostly accurate, keeping Urdu sounds and nuances and translating them into the Roman script effectively. All words are correctly transliterated. For example, 'نظریے' is correctly written as 'nazariye', 'حیاتی' as 'hiyati', 'اجسام' as 'ajzaam', 'بقا' as 'baqa', 'ماحول' as 'maahaul', and 'تبدیل' as 'tabdeel'. The use of 'ke', 'ke', 'ke', and 'ke' for 'کے' maintains consistency. Capitalization isn't generally applied in such transliterations since proper nouns aren't involved, and the sentence does not begin with a capital letter, as this is a transliteration and not a translation or sentence in formal English prose.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu in the output is very accurate with respect to the original text. Each word in the Urdu sentence is correctly and appropriately transliterated into Roman Urdu. For example, 'نظریے' is transliterated as 'nazarye', 'حیاتی اجسام' as 'hayati ajsam', and 'مطابق' as 'mutabiq'. Furthermore, the transliteration maintains the integrity of the words, faithfully representing the sounds and spellings as spoken in Urdu. There are no capitalization errors in the output, which is expected because the text does not have proper nouns requiring capitalization.",100
"The transliteration seems highly accurate. The terms 'عشرہ مبشرہ', 'حضرت محمد مصطفی', 'صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم', and 'صحابہ' are perfectly transliterated to 'ashra mubashra', 'Hazrat Muhammad Mustafa', 'Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam', and 'sahaba' respectively. These transliterations preserve the phonetics of the original Urdu words effectively. Proper names and honorifics are capitalized, such as 'Hazrat', 'Muhammad Mustafa', and 'Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,' which respects the cultural and religious significance of these terms. Furthermore, other words in the sentence are accurately converted with respect to Urdu pronunciation and spelling variations in transliteration, such as 'hain', 'jinhein', 'zindagi', 'jannat', 'bisharat', 'de di gayi'. The capitalization of non-proper nouns is correctly done with lowercase, maintaining the general norms of transliterations into English.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is correct in terms of phonetic pronunciation of each word. Terms such as 'عشرہ مبشرہ', 'حضرت محمد مصطفی صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم', 'صحابہ', 'زندگی', and 'جنت' have been well transliterated into Roman Urdu as 'Asra Mobshera', 'Hazrat Muhammad Mustafa Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam', 'Sahaba', 'zindagi', and 'Jannat', respectively. However, the phrase 'عشرہ مبشرہ' (Ashara Mubashshara) is generally known and transliterated as 'Ashra Mubashra', indicating a minor error in transliteration of 'مبشرہ' as 'Mobshera' instead of 'Mubashra'. The rest of the transliteration maintains the correct phonetic representation. Capitalization is correctly applied to proper nouns which is consistent with the norms for transliterating names and honorifics from Urdu to English-based scripts. Overall, the output is accurate, maintaining the phonetic integrity of the original text except for the slight discrepancy in the transliteration of 'مبشرہ'.",95
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu in this sentence is overall quite accurate. The proper names and terms specific to Islamic context are well-preserved with appropriate transliteration. 'عشرہ مبشرہ' is transliterated as 'ashrah mubashsharah', and 'حضرت محمد مصطفی صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم' as 'hazrat muhammad mustafa sallallahu alyhi wasallam', which maintains the integrity and respect due to religious text. The phrase 'کے وہ صحابہ ہیں' is accurately turned into 'ke wo sahaba hen', and the overall sentence structure in transliteration represents the original Urdu meaning correctly. However, minor issues such as lack of consistent capitalization of proper nouns (e.g., 'Hazrat Muhammad Mustafa Sallallahu Alyhi Wasallam' should have all initial capitals for each name for consistency in proper noun capitalization), and minor grammatical considerations in English transliteration context could be better aligned.",94
"The output effectively converts the Urdu script to the Roman Urdu alphabet. Key terms like 'عشرہ مبشرہ' (ashrah mubashira), 'حضرت محمد مصطفی' (hazrat muhammad mustafa), and 'صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم' (sallallahu alyhi wasallam) are accurately transliterated according to commonly accepted standards in Urdu transliteration. Other words such as 'صحابہ' (sahaaba), 'زندگی' (zindagi), 'جنت' (jannat) and 'بشارت' (basharat) are also correctly transliterated. Further, the transition phrase 'ہیں جنہیں' is coherently transliterated as 'hain jinhein', and the sentence construction in the transliterated text maintains the meaning and context of the original Urdu sentence. The capitalization of specific names, commonly respected titles, and proper nouns is handled well, maintaining the distinction and respect in the transliteration. The capitalization of the phrase 'hazrat muhammad mustafa' could be improved by capitalizing each word for proper noun emphasis in English transliteration norms, however, in the context of informal transliteration practices, this is acceptable.",98
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is quite accurate and reflects a good understanding of the transliteration system. Each word has been correctly converted to its Roman Urdu equivalent and the sentence structure has been maintained. However, the transliteration of 'اے کے' as 'A K' suggests initialization rather than a pronunciation-based transliteration. In a typical transliteration scenario, particularly considering the context of Urdu phrases, 'اے کے' could be intended to represent names or initials, yet it might better represent a person's initials literally without aiming for phonetic accuracy. Hence, while technically correct, it might cause some confusion in understanding unless familiar with the context. Capitalization is appropriate as 'A' and 'K' are considered proper nouns, presumed to be initials, and other words are not capitalized unnecessarily.",95
"The transliteration output accurately captures the pronunciation of the Urdu text. Each word in the output is a close phonetic match to its Urdu counterpart, preserving the sentence's meaning. However, the output entirely disregarded capitalisation, as the initial letter 'A' should be capitalised like 'Ay ke exam...' to start the sentence correctly. Despite this minor issue in capitalisation, the transliteration of the words themselves is excellent.",95
"The output successfully captures the transliteration from Urdu to English with minor issues. The transliteration accurately reflects the phonetics of Urdu words into English, maintaining a high degree of correctness effectively. For instance, 'امتحان' is transliterated as 'amtehaan', which preserves the phonetic essence accurately. Similarly, 'پوزیشن' to 'pozishan' and 'حاصل' to 'haasil' are well rendered. The capitalization of 'K' in the transliteration of 'اے کے' as 'a K' is incorrect as it should not be capitalized; 'a k' would be more appropriate. This capitalization error slightly affects the quality of the transliterated text. The phrases 'میں', 'ایک', 'بار', 'پھر', and 'کی' are correctly transliterated as 'mein', 'ek', 'baar', 'phir', and 'ki' respectively.",90
"The transliteration from Urdu to English is accurately rendered for various words. 'امتحان' is correctly transliterated as 'imtehaan', 'ایک' as 'ek', 'بار' as 'baar', 'پھر' as 'phir', 'پہلی' as 'pehli', 'پوزیشن' as 'position', and 'حاصل کی' as 'haasil ki'. The translation respects the original meaning and accurately renders the phonetics of the Urdu script into Roman English. Additionally, the capitalization of the initial word 'A' is appropriately used, aligning with English standards as it is derived from 'اے', which is essentially a personal or place name signifier in transliteration and can be capitalized.",98
"The transliteration from Urdu to the Roman script is very accurate. Each word is correctly transliterated keeping in mind the phonetic sounds of Urdu to English. The phrase 'جن سے ان کی کمپوزیشن کی مہارت کا احساس ہوتا ہے' is correctly rendered as 'jin se in ki composition ki maharat ka ehsaas hota hai.' The transliteration of 'کمپوزیشن' (composition) to its direct English equivalent retains its meaning accurately and fits well within the Urdu-to-English context. Proper capitalization is consistent, with no capital letters used since none are needed in this context. Overall, the transliteration shows a high level of correctness and proper mapping of sounds and meanings from Urdu to English.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to Latin script in the output is accurate for all words, maintaining a high degree of correctness. Each Urdu word corresponds correctly to its Romanized counterpart. The words 'جن', 'سے', 'ان', 'کی', 'کمپوزیشن', 'مہارت', 'کا', 'احساس', and 'ہوتا' are accurately transliterated as 'Jin', 'se', 'in', 'ki', 'kompozeeshun', 'maharat', 'ka', 'ehsaas', and 'hota' respectively. Moreover, the transliteration follows common conventions for the sounds not directly represented in the Latin alphabet, such as 'ح' being represented as 'h' in 'ehsaas'. The score is reduced slightly due to capitalization inconsistencies, as Urdu does not use capitalization and standard practice for English transliteration would typically not capitalize words in this context.",95
"The transliteration from Urdu to Latin script is accurately executed. The words 'جن' (jin), 'سے' (se), 'ان' (un), 'کی' (ki), 'کمپوزیشن' (kompozishn), 'کی' again (ki), 'مہارت' (maharat), 'کا' (ka), 'احساس' (ehsas), 'ہوتا' (hota), and 'ہے' (hai) have been correctly transliterated according to standard norms. There are no capitalization requirements in this sentence as it does not contain proper nouns.",100
"Firstly, it is important to note that 'جن سے' should be transliterated as 'jin se', which is correctly done in the output. Similarly, 'ان کی' is accurately transliterated as 'un ki'. However, 'کمپوزیشن' should be transliterated as 'composition' to reflect the proper Urdu pronunciation but is incorrectly transliterated as 'commision'. 'مہارت' has been aptly transliterated as 'maharat' and 'احساس' as 'ehsaas'. Lastly, 'ہوتا ہے' is correctly rendered as 'hota hai'. The transliteration has a major error with the word 'کمپوزیشن', and since correct word spelling is vital for accurately recommending a transliteration, this significantly affects the score. Furthermore, proper capitalization is not a factor here as Urdu does not use capital letters, and the output appropriately uses all lowercase letters in alignment with common transliteration conventions for casual text.",85
"The transliteration of the given Urdu text into Roman Urdu is generally accurate, with mild variations that slightly impact the transliteration quality. The words 'اسے' (ise), 'عقیدے' (aqeeday), 'حصہ' (hissa), 'بنا لیا گیا' (bana liya gaya), 'کہ' (ke), 'ویدوں' (vedon), 'عبور' (uboor), 'مستقل' (musataqil), 'بینی' (bini), 'میں' (mein), 'معاونت' (muawinat), 'کر سکتا ہے' (kar sakta hai) are all transliterated correctly and closely match the input text. The choice of words such as 'aqeeday' for 'عقیدے' and 'vedon' for 'ویدوں', and 'uboor' for 'عبور' are practical choices given the variety in possible spellings for the transliteration of Urdu. Moreover, there are no issues with capitalisations as capital letters aren't required in the output for transliteration. Overall, the transliterated text maintains the meaning and correctness quite effectively.",95
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu seems quite accurate with mostly minor deviations. The words 'اسے', 'عقیدے', 'کا', 'حصہ', 'بنا', 'لیا', 'گیا', 'کہ', 'پر', 'میں', 'بھی', 'کر', 'سکتا', 'ہے' are correctly transliterated to 'Usay', 'aqeeday', 'ka', 'hissa', 'bana', 'liya', 'gaya', 'keh', 'par', 'mein', 'bhi', 'kar', 'sakta', 'hai'. Furthermore, the text is clear and capitalisation is proper throughout the output. However, the word 'ویدوں' is slightly inaccurately transliterated as 'vidoon' instead of 'vedon', and 'عبور' is transliterated as 'ibaarat' instead of 'uboor'. Also, the word 'مستقل' is transliterated as 'mustaqil bini', where 'bini' seems added. Although these are minor errors, they are critical for precise understanding and correctness.",85
"The transliterated text is mostly accurate in capturing the correct pronunciation and spellings of the Urdu words in Roman script. The sequence and choice of words also correspond well to the input text. The words 'اسے', 'عقیدے', 'کا', 'حصہ', 'بنا', 'لیا', 'گیا', 'کہ', 'ویدوں', 'پر', 'عبور', 'مستقل', 'بینی', 'میں', 'بھی', 'معاونت', 'کر', 'سکتا', 'ہے' are correctly transliterated as 'ise', 'aqeede', 'ka', 'hissa', 'bana', 'liya', 'gaya', 'ke', 'widoon', 'par', 'uboor', 'mustaqil', 'bani', 'mein', 'bhi', 'muawnat', 'kar', 'sakta', 'hai', maintaining the meaning and pronunciation. However, 'ویدوں' should be transliterated as 'vedon' instead of 'widoon', and 'بینی' is mistakenly transliterated as 'bani' instead of the correct 'beeni'. The word 'mustaqil beeni' represents a combination which often translates to 'persistent vision/perception'. This error impacts the correctness slightly. Capitalization is not an issue here, as Urdu uses a script without capital letters and the English transliteration naturally does not require capitalization unless for proper nouns or starting sentences.",85
"The transliteration of the text from Urdu to Roman Urdu is mostly accurate with respect to the pronunciation of the words in Urdu. However, there are some minor errors in the transliteration, such as 'ویدوں' which has been transliterated as 'vidon' instead of the correct 'vedon'. Additionally, 'بینی' is transliterated as 'buniyad' but should be 'baini' to be more accurate. The capitalizeations of proper nouns or specific initials is correct, as there are no such entities needing capitalization in this sentence. Overall, the transliterated output is coherent with a couple of errors.",85
"The transliteration provided is broadly accurate with respect to the original Urdu input. The Urdu words are largely properly transliterated into Roman script. Words like 'اس کا نام' are accurately transliterated as 'is ka naam'. 'نجمان' as 'Najman' is a reasonable transliteration as well. Similarly, 'دو الفاظ کا مرکب ہے' is properly transliterated as 'do alfaaz ka murakkab hai'. The phrase 'نجم یعنی ستارہ' is well-transliterated as 'Najm ya'ni sitara', and 'خاندان سے' is correctly rendered as 'Khaandan se'. The numerals (1, 2) are retained as in the input. The capitalization overall is properly used, with proper nouns and the beginning of sentences being capitalized, and list items following after numerals also correctly capitalized. Therefore, the transliteration is highly accurate both in terms of word correctness and capitalization.",98
"In the output: 'اس کا نام' is correctly transliterated as 'Is ka naam'. 'نجمان دو الفاظ کا مرکب ہے' is only partially correctly transliterated to 'Najman do alfaz ka muqaddam hai'. 'Najman' should be 'Najman', 'alfaz' is correct, but 'muqaddam' should be 'murakkab'. 'نجم یعنی ستارہ' is incorrectly transliterated to 'Nijam means star' ('Nijam' should be 'Najm'). 'اور' is accurately transliterated as 'aur'. However, 'خاندان سے' is mistransliterated as 'Khānadan se'; 'خاندان' doesn't align with the word 'family', but rather 'Najman se' from the original Urdu is missing which has led to the confusion in transliteration mentioned. Capitalisation is generally handled well but the capitalisation of 'Khānadan' following a dash is incorrect.",60
"The transliteration is mostly accurate, but there are some minor deviations and errors. The word 'نجمان' is transliterated as 'najmaan' where it should be 'najman' to represent a composite rather than a prolongation. 'مرکب' is wrongly transliterated as 'marakkib' instead of 'mirkab' or 'murakkab,' which affects the correctness. The words 'ستارہ' and 'خاندان' are translated well into 'sitara' and 'khandan.' Overall, the transliteration captures the essence of the text, but there are errors in crucial words that impact the accuracy.",86
"The transliteration output is largely accurate, capturing the essence of the Urdu input text well. Key words such as 'نجمان' are appropriately transliterated as 'Najman,' and 'مرکب' as 'murakkab.' However, there are minor errors including 'ستارہ' which should be transliterated as 'sitara' but is mistakenly written as 'satara.' Additionally, some capitalization inconsistencies are noted, such as starting 'khandaan' in lowercase. Moreover, the transliteration of 'do' for 'دو' could be debateable, but it is commonly accepted.",90
"The transliteration from Urdu to English is accurate in terms of phonetic representation of almost all words. The words 'علم' ('Ilm'), 'قرات' ('qiraat'), 'شیخاں' ('sheikhan'), 'والی' ('wali'), 'مسجد' ('masjid'), 'خانیوال' ('Khanewal'), 'سے' ('se'), and 'حاصل کیا' ('haasil kiya') are all correctly transliterated to reflect the way they are pronounced in Urdu. Moreover, the capitalisation of 'Khanewal', a proper noun, is correctly handled as per English norms for naming places. All other words are correctly presented in lowercase. Since no transcription errors are apparent and correct capitalisation is maintained, the transliteration is of high quality.",100
"The transliteration of the input Urdu text into Roman script is accurate and aligns well with general transliteration norms. The words 'علم' (ilm), 'قرات' (qirat), 'شیخاں' (sheikhan), 'والی' (wali), 'مسجد' (masjid), 'خانیوال' (khaniwal), 'سے' (se), and 'حاصل کیا' (hasil kiya) are correctly rendered in accordance with the pronunciation in Urdu. Each word's transliteration is appropriate. However, capitalisation conventions for transliterating proper nouns from Urdu to English are not applicable here as transliteration into Roman script often does not involve capitalisation except for proper modern names or beginning of sentences, so there's no need for capital letters here.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to the Roman script is quite precise. The word 'علم' is correctly transliterated as 'ilm', 'قرات' as 'qiraat', 'شیخاں' as 'shaikhon', 'والی' as 'wali', 'مسجد' as 'masjid', 'خانیوال' as 'khaniwal', 'سے' as 'se', and 'حاصل کیا' as 'haasil kiya'. All the words are correctly transliterated considering phonetic accuracy in the Roman script. The capitalization is consistent and appropriate as proper nouns need not be capitalized in this context.",98
"The transliteration is generally good in terms of the representation of words from Urdu to a Romanized form. 'علم' is accurately transliterated to 'ilm', 'قرات' to 'quraat', 'شیخاں والی' to 'Sheikhan wali', 'مسجد' to 'masjid', 'خانیوال' to 'Khanywal', and 'سے حاصل کیا' to 'se haasil kiya'. However, there are a couple of minor capitalization errors in the transliteration: 'Sheikhan' should not be capitalized unless it is part of a proper noun or starting a sentence, and the same applies to 'Khanywal'. However, in geographical names, initial capitalization is common, making 'Khanywal' acceptable but somewhat debatable. Hence, the score reflects a minor penalty for potential issues in capitalization conventions.",95
"The transliterated output is very accurate in terms of the Urdu to Roman script conversion. The phrases 'is ke baad se' correctly match 'اس کے بعد سے', and 'Buenos Aires ko tijarati markaz ban gaya' matches 'بیونس آئرس کو تجارتی مرکز بن گیا'. The city name 'Buenos Aires' is properly capitalized, which is important as it is a proper noun and should be capitalized in the Roman script. Additionally, the transliteration of other words like 'tijarati' (تجارتی) and 'markaz' (مرکز) are consistent with common transliteration standards. There is no apparent error or significant discrepancy observed in the rendering of the transliterated text.",100
"The transliteration from Urdu to the Roman script in the provided output is quite accurate. The phrase 'اس کے بعد سے' is correctly transliterated as 'Is ke baad se,' which accurately captures the pronunciation of the Urdu text. Similarly, 'بیونس آئرس' is transliterated perfectly as 'Buenos Aires,' reflecting the proper noun's conventional spelling in English. 'کو تجارتی مرکز بن گیا' is also accurately translated to 'ko tijaari markaz ban gaya,' matching the phonetic sound of the Urdu words. The only minor point is the use of 'tijaari' for 'تجارتی,' which can also be conventionally transliterated as 'tijarti' or 'tijarati,' but 'tijaari' is also an acceptable variation. The text correctly neglects the capitalization of common nouns and only applies it to the proper noun 'Buenos Aires,' which is consistent with English capitalization rules.",97
"The transliteration from Urdu to Roman Urdu is overall correctly done. The names and words are properly transliterated. 'اس کے بعد سے' is transliterated as 'is ke baad se', which closely matches the pronunciation; 'بیونس آئرس' is correctly transliterated to its English name 'Buenos Aires', reflecting their pronunciation and usual representation in English; 'کو' translated to 'ko' is appropriate; 'تجارتی' to 'tijaarati' is correct; 'مرکز' to 'markaz' matches its common pronunciation; and 'بن گیا' to 'ban gaya' maintains the correctness. The capitalization of 'Buenos Aires' is appropriate as it is a proper noun. Hence, the transliteration maintains the meanings and sound of the original text and is done with precision.",100
"The transliteration provided for the majority of the text remains accurate with good matching to the sounds in Urdu. For 'اس کے بعد سے' the transliteration 'is ke baad se' is correct. The phrase 'تجارتی مرکز بن گیا' is accurately transliterated as 'tijaarati markaz ban gaya.' However, the major discrepancy arises with the proper noun بیونس آئرس, which should be transliterated closer to 'Buenos Aires' to reflect its standard spelling in English (and it's widely recognized transliteration from Urdu). The output provided misspells it as 'Bens Aires', which significantly deviates from the globally recognized spelling, affecting the correctness criterion.",75
"The transliteration output accurately reflects the input Urdu text into Roman Urdu. The transliteration of 'پر', 'یہ', 'تین', 'اداروں', 'کا', 'حصہ', 'ہی', 'تصور', 'کیے', 'جاتے', 'ہیں' as 'par', 'yeh', 'teen', 'idaron', 'ka', 'hissa', 'hi', 'tasawur', 'kiye', 'jatay', 'hain' respectively is correct. They maintain the meaning and pronunciation from the original Urdu. The names 'Mossad', 'Aman', and 'Shin Beth' are properly capitalized, correctly following the capitalization rule for proper nouns in transliteration. Additionally, the introduction of a comma between 'Mossad', 'Aman', and 'Shin Beth' correctly indicates a list of items, which is a correct use of punctuation in this context.",100
"The transliteration output is overall accurate in capturing the pronunciation and meaning of the Urdu words into Roman script. The words 'پر', 'یہ', 'تین', 'اداروں', 'موساد', 'امن', 'اور', 'شین باتھ', 'کا', 'حصہ', 'ہی', 'تصور', 'کیے', 'جاتے', and 'ہیں' are correctly transliterated as 'par', 'yeh', 'teen', 'adaroN', 'mōsād', 'āman', 'aur', 'shēn bāth', 'kā', 'hisah', 'hī', 'tasvur', 'kiyā', 'jātay', and 'hain' respectively, maintaining correct pronunciation. However, 'حصہ' is written as 'hisah' which is acceptable but unusual as 'hissa' could be more common; 'تصور' is written as 'tasvur' where 'tasawur' is more usual. Despite these minor variances, the transliteration is quite good and comprehensible. Capitalization isn't relevant in Urdu transliteration using the Roman alphabet since Urdu doesn't use capital letters. Given this, the output ably represents the original Urdu script.",90
"The transliteration from Urdu to English seems mostly accurate. The transliteration of 'پر' to 'per', 'یہ' to 'ye', 'تین' to 'teen', 'اداروں' to 'idaaron', 'امن' to 'aman', 'اور' to 'aur', 'کا' to 'ka', 'حصہ' to 'hissa', 'ہی' to 'hi', 'تصور' to 'tasawwur', 'کیے' to 'kiye', 'جاتے' to 'jaate', and 'ہیں' to 'hain' are all correctly and appropriately transliterated. However, the organization's names 'Mossad' and 'Shin Bath' (should be 'Shin Bet') are partially correct; 'Mossad' is correct but 'Shin Bath' is inaccurately transliterated as 'Bath' instead of 'Bet'. The capitalization is correctly applied to 'Mossad' and 'Shin Bath', which are proper nouns.",95
"The output correctly transliterates the Urdu sentence into Roman Urdu while preserving both word accuracy and proper capitalization for names. The words 'پر', 'یہ', 'تین', 'اداروں', 'کا', 'حصہ', 'ہی', 'تصور', 'کیے', 'جاتے', 'ہیں' are accurately transliterated as 'par', 'ye', 'teen', 'idaaron', 'ka', 'hissa', 'hi', 'tasawwur', 'kiye', 'jaate', 'hain'. Additionally, the names 'Mossad', 'Aman', and 'Shin Bath' (intended as 'Shin Bet', commonly known, but sometimes anglicized as 'Bath') are capitalized correctly, reflecting their use as proper nouns. The transliteration shows comprehensive understanding and correct application.",98
"The output has done well in transliterating the Urdu text into English phonetics with a few minor errors in spellings and omissions. 'میکانیکی' should be transliterated as 'mechanical' but is represented as 'mechanicaly'. Similarly, 'تالیف' is fairly translated as 'talif', although 'taleef' could also be an alternate spelling, so the spelling here is acceptable. The phrase 'نظریاتی اور تحقیقی شعبۂ کیمیاء' is correctly transliterated to 'nazriati aur tehqiqi shoba-e-kimya', and 'کیمیائی تالیف جیسے تعملات' is effectively translated to 'chemical talif jaise ta'amlaat' although 'chemical' in this usage should ideally follow a similar transliteration structure. Additionally, the text 'کو میکانیکی' is incomplete in the output as it fails to finalize with the transliteration of 'کو', creating an unfinished statement. Capitalization is applied correctly to proper nouns and the start of sentences.",75
"The transliteration model has accurately converted most of the Urdu text into Roman Urdu. Words like 'mechanosynthesis', 'asal', 'mein', 'nazariati', 'aur', 'tahqiqi', 'shuba', 'kemia', 'hai', 'jahan', 'kemiai', 'taliif', 'jaise', and 'tamal' are appropriately transliterated maintaining the meaning and phonetic structure from Urdu to Roman script. However, there are some shortcomings such as 'mechaniki' which seems to be the incorrect end of the transliteration, possibly should be 'mechaniki' in a different form or completed. Additionally, the transliteration output has inaccurately stopped, missing the end part of the input sentence, especially the phrase about 'mechanical processes' which seems to be partially represented and incomplete. The translation for the word 'تعملات' could be more precisely transliterated to better reflect its plural nature ('tamalat' rather than 'tamel').",80
"The transliterated text from Urdu to English largely captures the phonetic spelling of most Urdu terms quite well, but has missed and truncated some crucial words. The phrase 'mechanosynthesis asal mein nazariyaati aur tahqeeqi shoba kee hai' accurately translates to 'mechanosynthesis basically is a theoretical and research branch'. However, the words 'کیمیاء' (chemistry), 'جہاں' (where), 'کیمیائی' (chemical), 'تالیف' (synthesis), 'جیسے' (like), and 'تعملات' (reactions) were not completely or accurately captured in some instances. 'میکانیکی' translated as 'mechanic' towards the end is incorrect and truncates the context, the term should be 'mechanical'. Also, proper capitalization is generally absent, although not typically expected in Urdu-to-English transliteration mapping. Therefore, based on correctness of words and some missing parts, the transliteration quality needs improvement.",60
"The transliteration model has maintained reasonable accuracy with concerns to the Urdu to English conversion. However, it inaccurately switches 'میکانیکی تالیف' to 'mechanical taleef' where 'mechanosynthesis' was more accurate and provided in parentheses as it was originally. Also, the transliteration of 'تعملات' into 'taamaat' deviates from a more correct transliteration such as 'tamlaat'. Moreover, the word 'شعبۂ' has been incorrectly transliterated into 'shoba' instead of the more accurate 'shu'bah'. These transliteration errors impact both the accuracy and comprehensibility of the text. Additionally, there is improper capitalisation in the text, where every word starts with a lowercase letter despite them appearing after a parenthesis closure, which should prompt an uppercase start.",65
"The transliterated text accurately converts each Urdu word to its Roman Urdu counterpart, preserving the meaning and context effectively. The words 'فیض رحمان' are correctly transliterated as 'Faiz Rahman', and other words such as 'پیشہ ورانہ', 'دور اندیشی', 'میڈیا', 'جدید', 'ٹیکنالوجی', 'استعمال', 'دنیا بھر', 'جداگانہ', and 'مقام' are well transliterated as 'pesha warana', 'door andeshi', 'media', 'jadeed', 'technology', 'istemal', 'duniya bhar', 'judagana', and 'maqam' respectively. The sentence ends with 'رکھتے ہیں' correctly turned into 'rakhtay hain'. As for capitalization, proper nouns are appropriately capitalized. Overall, the transliteration maintains high fidelity to the source while ensuring readability and grammatical structure in Roman Urdu.",98
"The transliteration output contains several inaccuracies and inconsistencies compared to a standard transliteration from Urdu to English. Specifically, the name 'فیض رحمان' is transliterated as 'Fayyaz Rahmaan' which changes the first name slightly by elongating it. The transcription of 'پیشہ ورانہ' to 'pehwaanay walaan' deviates significantly from a typical transliteration; it should be something akin to 'pesha warana.' Additionally, 'دور اندیشی' is incorrectly rendered as 'dur andisha' where 'door' or 'door andeshi' might be more appropriate. The term 'ٹیکنالوجی' is represented as 'tekinoolozi,' which is uncharacteristically misshapen compared to the more accurate transcription 'technology' adapted to Urdu phonetics. The word 'جداگانہ' is further misconstrued as 'jazaa-e-gaanaah' instead of 'jadagana.' Overall, the translation is not cohesive or standard, resulting in a confusing output.",35
"The output effectively preserves the meaning of the input Urdu text in the romanized form with minor transcription variations that still keep within common transliteration practices. 'پیشہ ورانہ' was transliterated as 'peshwa waraana', where a more typical transliteration might be 'pehshewarana' or 'peshewarana'. Similarly, 'دور اندیشی' is rendered as 'daur andeshi', which appropriately captures the sound although 'door andeshi' might align more strictly with pronunciation. The words 'جداگانہ' is transliterated to 'judaagaana', where 'judagana' would be more streamlined yet retains understandable form. Additionally, the output maintains uniform lowercase presentation, adhering to appropriate capitalization for transliterated Urdu text where typically only proper nouns might be capitalized, and the text contains only the name 'Faiz Rahman' correctly capitalized. Overall, despite minor differences in transliteration preference, the output is highly readable and accurate.",93
"The transliteration of the input Urdu text to Roman Urdu is mostly correct in terms of word correctness and spelling, although there are a few inconsistencies. 'پیشہ ورانہ' has been transliterated as 'pesha warana', which is acceptable though 'pehshwarana' might also be seen. 'دور اندیشی' is transliterated to 'daur andazi', which can be critical since 'andazi' connotes 'estimation', whereas 'andooshi' directly refers to 'foresight' or 'vision', which is more accurate contextually. Though the meaning conveyed is roughly similar, the choice of exact words could be nuanced better for precise meaning. Words like 'jadeed', 'technology', 'istemaal', 'duniya', 'bhar', and 'muqaam' are correctly transliterated. The capitalization is also proper without any error since capitalization rules in Roman Urdu are primarily applied to proper nouns (in this case, the name 'Faiz Rahman') which here are correctly capitalized.",85
