"The output slightly rephrases the original sentence while preserving the original meaning. The change from 'ورنا مسکرائی۔' to 'ورنا نے مسکرا دیا۔' maintains the semantic content, expressing that Verna smiled. The addition of 'نے' and the change of 'مسکرائی' to 'مسکرا دیا' demonstrate a minor structural change but do not significantly alter the meaning or emotional tone. Therefore, both the condition of using different words and preserving the original meaning are met, and there are no grammatical errors.",95
"The paraphrased output 'حس میں مسکرائی۔' uses a different word 'حس' instead of 'ورنا', but this change slightly alters the original meaning. The word 'ورنا' (otherwise) implies a condition or alternative, while 'حس' (sense or feeling) doesn't carry the same connotation. The grammatical structure is maintained accurately. However, because the change of word shifts the implied meaning, the paraphrase is not entirely accurate in retaining the original message.",70
"The output introduces additional details (e.g., 'اپنی انگلیاں ہلائیں') that are not present in the original input, which may alter the basic scene portrayed. While the paraphrase keeps the action of smiling from the original ('مسکرائی' changed to 'مسکراتے ہوئے'), the added actions change the focus of the sentence. Hence, the paraphrase somewhat deviates from the original meaning. However, it remains grammatically correct and uses different words and phrases.",60
"The output text changes the original meaning significantly. The input text states that 'ورنا مسکرائی۔' which translates to 'Verna smiled.' However, the output text 'ورنا نے ہنسنے سے انکار کر دیا۔' translates to 'Verna refused to laugh.' There's a stark contrast between smiling and refusing to laugh, hence the meaning is not retained. Additionally, while different words are used, this is irrelevant because the key idea of the original text is lost completely. There are no grammatical errors in the output.",15
"The paraphrased text effectively captures the essence of the original message. It maintains the core idea that the speaker initially didn't think much about his sneezing, but now people are noticing and suggesting a doctor's consultation. Both sentences communicate similar concepts, using alternative phrasing effectively without altering the original meaning. There are no grammatical errors in the output. The use of synonyms and slightly altered sentence structure demonstrates a good level of paraphrasing skill. Overall, the output stays true to the original intent with good linguistic accuracy and appropriate rephrasing.",95
"The output changes the subject from sneezing to the face, which alters the original context significantly. While both texts suggest seeking a doctor's consultation, the reasoning behind it is different due to the subject change (sneezing vs. observing the face). This changes the key idea being communicated, thus failing to retain the original meaning. The output has no grammatical errors and uses different words and phrases, but the shift in subject matter is critical enough to lower the score substantially.",50
"The output significantly truncates the original message. The input text mentions 'recently people are noticing and commenting on my sneezing, and some are advising me to see a doctor.' This significant detail about people's responses and the advice given is completely omitted in the output. This omission alters the meaning and context of the statement. Thus, the output fails in retaining the original meaning while it is free from grammatical errors.",20
"The output does not retain the original meaning and details of the input text. The input text describes a situation where the speaker never gave it a second thought, but recently noticed that people are observing and commenting on their sneezing, suggesting some advised meeting a doctor. The output simply translates to 'People told me to meet a doctor,' which omits significant details about the narrator's lack of initial concern, the recent observation by others, and comments on sneezing. Thus, not capturing the essence or context provided in the input.",40
"Output maintains the original meaning by discussing the skepticism of people towards recommendations and the typical scenarios in revenue creation, which involve unclear income targets. There are no grammatical errors in the output, and it successfully uses synonyms and rephrased sentences to convey the same message. The key ideas like skepticism regarding recommendations and common situations in revenue settings without clear targets are retained. However, the output simplistically mirrors the input without introducing more sophisticated vocabulary or restructuring more complexly.",85
"The output retains the original meaning effectively, discussing the consideration recommended for those involved or following the commission's recommendations concerning rate setting situations with zero revenue involved. The rephrasing is smooth and uses different, although still closely related, word choices like 'وہ لوگ' instead of 'ان لوگوں کے لیے' and 'مدنظر رکھیں گے' instead of 'غور کریں گے'. There are no grammatical errors in the output, maintaining the quality of the provided text. The paraphrase manages to keep crucial information and does not deviate from the context or comprehensive meaning intended in the original text.",90
"The output has drastically altered the original meaning of the input text. The provided input states that those who choose to be overly critical of the commission's recommendations in certain areas, should consider that usually the situation involves zero sum, where someone works against a revenue target. However, the output wrongly claims that zero sum situations are not involved in rate-making, which is not only factually incorrect but also directly contradicts the given narrative from the input text. Furthermore, the output does not expand on, or accurately summarize, the complex issues and specific context presented in the input, leading to significant loss of original meaning and key ideas.",10
"The output text is a direct extraction from the input without paraphrasing or using different words and phrases, thereby failing to meet the key requirement of paraphrasing which is the rephrasing or restructuring of the original text using alternative expressions. The output is grammatically correct and retains the part of the original meaning it covers; however, it omits a significant portion of the input text, particularly in the first half, thus not fully representing the original content's intent about the context of those following the recommendations.",20
"The output provided retains the original meaning entirely, making it clear that the failure to understand the full requirements of the new system during the critical review of the design in 1997 was a significant factor. The paraphrase has used synonyms effectively and slightly modified the structure of the sentence while ensuring that there are no grammatical errors. Both the input and output express the same key idea with different phrasing, fulfilling all the criteria effectively.",95
"The paraphrased text contains a slightly altered wording from the input but makes a critical mistake in expressing the meaning. The input states that a major element was the 'lack of understanding of the complete requirements for the new system in the critical design review in 1997.' However, the output incorrectly states that 'he did not come to understand the complete requirements in the critical design review in 1997,' which shifts the structure and slightly changes the meaning by introducing ambiguity about who 'he' refers to. Additionally, the phrase 'نہیں آئے تھے' is incorrect and awkward in this context, making it a grammatical error.",60
"The output misses crucial information from the original text. The original sentence mentions a significant element related to the lack of understanding about the complete requirements for a new system in a critical review of design in 1997. However, the output just states that there was a critical review of the design in 1997, omitting the key point regarding the lack of understanding of the system's requirements. This lack of completeness alters the original meaning significantly. Moreover, while there are some word changes and rephrasing, the main issue is the substantial loss of important content.",20
"The output has retained the original meaning of missing the complete understanding of the requirements for a new system as a significant element in 1997. It also uses different word ordering and maintains grammatical accuracy. Therefore, it meets all criteria set for paraphrasing.",95
"The output successfully retains the original meaning of the input which is expressing the lack of necessity for a particular kind of graphics. The paraphrase is condensed but still clearly communicates the idea that unnecessary graphics are not needed, aligning well with the input's message. The phrase structure and choice of words in the output are different enough from the input to demonstrate good paraphrasing skills. Additionally, there are no grammatical errors in the output.",95
"The paraphrased text adequately retains the original message that there is no need for certain types of graphics that are unnecessary. However, the paraphrase introduces slight ambiguity with the phrase 'ہم اس قسم کے گرافکس میں نہیں لگتے' which is a less direct and slightly unclear way of saying 'we don't need.' Despite this small shift, the paraphrase is grammatically correct and attempts to use different words and sentence structures to convey the same essential idea. Still, the sense of unnecessary elements is preserved, raising its score.",85
"The output text simplifies and deviates slightly from the original input. While the output accurately captures the main idea that specific types of graphics are not needed, it omits the repetitive emphasis on 'اس قسم کی ضرورت نہیں' which is present twice in the input text. This repetition in the original text might be deliberate to emphasize the point, which is lost in the translation. Thus, while the grammatical structure of the output is correct and concise, it loses some part of the original emphasis. However, it uses somewhat similar words and lacks extensive rephrasing.",70
"The paraphrased text significantly reduces the content and details compared to the original. While it retains the basic idea that there is no need for a certain type of graphics, it fails to capture the repeated emphasis present in the original text on the lack of necessity ('ہمیں اس قسم کی ضرورت نہیں ہے' repeated twice). This repetition in the original text seems to amplify the assertion, but it is completely lost in the paraphrase. Furthermore, the paraphrased sentence reduces the message to a very simple form without considering the descriptive part ('جو صرف ضروری نہیں ہے'), changing the nuance of the message. Thereby, it does not satisfactorily retain the original meaning or the stylistic element of emphasis.",40
"The output effectively retains the original meaning which is expressing doubt or hesitation in the response. The original text 'میں نے شک سے کہا' directly translates to 'I said with doubt.' The paraphrased output 'میرے جواب میں تردد تھا' translates back to 'There was hesitation in my answer.' Both phrases convey a sense of uncertainty or hesitation in speaking, thus the meaning is preserved. Additionally, the output uses different words including 'جواب' and 'تردد' as opposed to 'کہا' and 'شک', showing effective word variety. There are no grammatical errors in the provided Urdu paraphrasing.",98
جملے میں الفاظ کا استعمال قریب قریب ایک جیسا ہی ہے، ہونے کے باوجود کہ  کچھ معمولی گرامری اختلاف ہے۔ اصل جملہ 'ہاں، میں نے شک سے کہا۔' ہے اور تبدیل شدہ جملہ 'میں نے شک سے کہا ہے' میں وقت کا فرق دیکھا جا سکتا ہے؛ 'کہا' کے بجائے 'کہا ہے' کا استعمال کیا گیا ہے جو زمانے میں معمولی تبدیلی کو ظاہر کرتا ہے، لیکن اصل مضمون کے معنی پر کوئی فرق نہیں پڑتا۔ اصل میں 'ہاں' کا کلمہ بھی موجود ہے جو ظاہر کرتا ہے کہ میں شک سے کہا وہ بیان کرنے کا اثبات فراہم کرتا ہے، جبکہ ثانوی جملے میں یہ نہیں ہے، جو کہ اصل مضمون سے کچھ فرق کرتا ہے۔ بنیادی طور پر عبارت کی باز آرائی اسی معنی کو برقرار رکھتی ہے لیکن اضافہ و تبدیلی بہت محدود ہے۔,55
اصل متن کے معنی برقرار نہیں رہے ہیں، کیونکہ اصل متن میں 'شک' کا ذکر ہے جو 'یقین' کی ضد ہے، اور 'اتفاق کرنا' 'کہنا' سے مختلف عمل ہے۔واضح تضاد ہونے کی وجہ سے باہمی مناسبت کا فقدان ہے، جس سے اصل میسیج تبدیل ہوگیا ہے۔,10
پیرافریزڈ ٹیکسٹ میں اصل معنیٰ اور خیال کو برقرار نہیں رکھا گیا ہے۔ اصل جملے میں 'شک' کا لفظ استعمال ہوا تھا جبکہ پیرافریزڈ ٹیکسٹ میں 'یقین' کہا گیا، جو کہ بنیادی مفہوم کو تبدیل کر دیتا ہے۔ اس کے علاوہ، گرائمیٹیکل اور الفاظی تبدیلیاں موجود ہیں، لیکن معنیٰ تبدیل ہونے کی وجہ سے اصل مواد سے عدم مطابقت ہے۔,10
"The output accurately retains the original meaning of the input text, which discusses someone being with others, otherwise they would not have returned. The paraphrase uses different words and phrases such as 'ایسا لگتا ہے' instead of 'ظاہر ہے' and 'واپس نہ لوٹتی' instead of 'واپس نہیں گئی ہوگی', which shows effective rephrasing while maintaining the message. The grammar is also correctly maintained in the output.",95
"The output has slightly changed the meaning of the input. The input suggests that because she has returned, it's obvious that she's with them ('یا وہ واپس نہیں گئی ہوگی' implies she indeed returned). However, the output suggests that although it seems she is with them, she will not return ('لیکن وہ واپس نہیں آئے گی,' implying she has not yet returned and will not in the future). This change in tense and context alters the original message significantly.",60
"The output does not retain the original meaning of the input. In the input, the context suggests an assumption of someone's presence with others because they did not return ('لیکن ظاہر ہے کہ وہ ان کے ساتھ ہے، یا وہ واپس نہیں گئی ہوگی'), while the output flatly states 'وہ وہاں نہیں ہے' which translates to 'He/She is not there', which is a direct contradiction to the suggested presence indicated in the input. The key ideas and context are lost, fundamentally altering the meaning. Moreover, there is minimal echo in wording as the entire structure and content of the phrase have been changed but not appropriately. There are no grammatical errors in the output, but since the original meaning is not retained, this aspect does not contribute positively to the overall score.",10
"The output text has completely reversed the meaning of the input text. The input suggests that someone is with others ('ظاہر ہے کہ وہ ان کے ساتھ ہے'), or else they would not have returned ('یا وہ واپس نہیں گئی ہوگی'). However, the output negates both conditions, stating that someone is not with others ('وہ ان کے ساتھ نہیں ہے') and implies they won't return ('وہ واپس نہیں جائے گی'). This completely distorts the original message, making the paraphrase inaccurate. There are no grammatical errors in the output, but since the alteration of meaning is drastic and goes against the criteria of retaining the original intent, the score is significantly low.",10
"The paraphrased output retains the original idea conveyed in the input, which is an expectation that something will prove worthwhile over time. The output uses different phrasing such as 'میرے خیال میں' instead of 'مجھے لگتا ہے' and 'وقت کے ساتھ بہتر ثابت ہوگا' instead of 'وقت کے قابل ہوگا', which shows good use of synonyms and alternative expressions, keeping the sentence grammatically correct. Hence, the translation maintains the core message, uses different wording, and is grammatically sound.",95
"Output's phrase structure and wording is changed significantly, making it a good paraphrase. However, the main message and meaning of the text remain the same, which is that the speaker expects something to be worth the time after a long period. Despite using different words, the message conveyed is almost the same. There's also a slight rearrangement in the sentence structure that still keeps the overall context intact. There are no grammatical errors.",90
"The paraphrased text captures the essence of the original meaning quite effectively. The primary idea that something 'will be worth the time' has been preserved. The changes involve slight alterations in the wording like 'میرے خیال میں' instead of 'مجھے لگتا ہے' which are synonyms and thus keep the meaning intact. The grammatical structure is correct as well. However, the phrase 'طویل عرصے میں', which can imply 'over a long period', has been omitted in the paraphrased version. This removal might slightly alter the emphasis on the duration aspect originally present in the statement.",85
"The original text 'طویل عرصے میں مجھے لگتا ہے کہ یہ واقعی وقت کے قابل ہوگا۔' includes the subject's personal feeling about the worth of the occurring discussed over a long period. The paraphrased version 'یہ وقت کے قابل ہوگا۔' omits the initial reference to a long period and the subject's feeling ('مجھے لگتا ہے'), losing significant contextual details. Although grammatically correct, the paraphrased text fails to capture the full essence and details of the original sentence, reducing its effectiveness in paraphrasing.",30
"The output text has successfully paraphrased the original text by using different words and changing the structure while maintaining the original meaning. The original repetitive phrases 'ٹھیک ہے یہ ٹھیک ہے' were skillfully condensed to 'ٹھیک ہے، یہ درست ہے,' thereby avoiding repetition and making it more succinct. The core idea about being overly focused on the budget due to past experiences ('اس وجہ کا ایک حصہ' to 'خاص طور پر پرجوش ہونے کی وجہ') has been preserved and clearly articulated. Additionally, there are no grammatical errors in the output.",95
"The paraphrased text maintains the original meaning, discussing the speculation about why they became obsessed with the budget in past years, reflecting on how they lived during those times. It introduces new phrases such as 'میں اور میرے ساتھ لوگ' instead of 'ہم', and uses 'کہ کیا وہ اس وجہ سے ہے' in place of 'جس کی وجہ سے'. Additionally, the output maintains grammatical integrity and remains free from errors. However, the repetitive 'یہ ٹھیک ہے' from the input has been compressed to a single occurrence in the output, making it more concise yet still faithful to the original message.",90
"The output significantly truncates the original text and loses a lot of the context and information provided in the input. The original text discusses not only an obsession with the budget but also connects it to a specific context or time period ('وہ سال تھے جہاں ہم اس طرح رہتے تھے'). This detail is essentially omitted in the output, reducing its informativeness considerably. Furthermore, the repetitive 'یہ ٹھیک ہے' parts are irrelevant and might be a build-up or stutter in speech not properly echoed in the paraphrase. While the paraphrase contains no grammatical errors and uses different phrases, the loss of substantial content impacts its score.",30
"The output summarily failed to retain most of the original detailed context, particularly the repetition of ‘یہ ٹھیک ہے’ which might have importance for emphasis or convey a certain mood. Moreover, it seemingly compresses much of the detailed exploration of reasons, and emotions surrounding their budget management into a single statement that does not reflect the breadth or specifics given in the original. There may also be a key interpretation error or omission concerning the description of the time period mentioned ('کہ وہ سال تھے جہاں ہم اس طرح رہتے تھے'), which significantly changes the intended message. However, grammatically, the output does form a complete and error-free sentence, and it uses different words and phrases, but dwarfing the context does not fully compensate for these.",25
اوپٹ آؤٹ ٹیکسٹ نے اس بنیادی خیال کو برقرار رکھا ہے کہ 1291 میں Mamelukes نے Acre کو فتح کیا جسکی وجہ سے صلیبی جنگیں ختم ہوئ گئیں۔ تاہم، پیرافریز کیا گیا مواد Mamelukes کی تفصیلات (ترک / سرکیسیائی نسل کے آزاد کردہ غلام) کو حذف کرتا ہے، جو اصل متن کے اہم جز کو چھوڑ دیتا ہے۔ نیا متن کا معیاری گرامر ہے اور اصلی متن کے مقابلے میں مختلف الفاظ اور فریزوں کا استعمال ہوتا ہے۔ اگرچہ، مواد کی بنیاد پر کچھ اہم معلومات کی کمی اور اصلی مواد کا مختلف ترجمہ کے کے باوجود اچھی طرح تفصیلی بیان موجود نہیں ہے، اسی لئے درجہ بندی کم ہو سکتی ہے۔,70
"The paraphrased text retains the original meaning effectively, mentioning the Mamelukes, labeled as freed slaves of Turkish and Circassian descent, coming into power in 1291 and marking the end of the Crusader era. It uses somewhat different vocabulary to express the same ideas. Although the phrasing slightly changes the chronological presentation, the main points remain consistent with the original. The text is grammatically correct in Urdu.",90
"The output not only simplifies the information but also significantly distorts it. The original text explains the specific event in 1291 where Acre was taken over by the Egyptian Mamelukes, marking the end of the Crusader era. The Mamelukes are described as Turk/Circassian freed slaves. However, the output falsely represents the Mamelukes as 'a freed slave', losing all contextual details about the historical event, the role of Acre, and the broader implications of the conquest. There are also no grammatical errors, but the paraphrase overall fails to retain the essential meaning and details of the original text.",20
"The output text captures the essence of the original text by indicating that the Egyptian Mamelukes took over Acre (Akko) in 1291. However, it fails to include the specific details about the Mamelukes being of Turkic/Circassian descent and previously freed slaves, which were crucial elements in the original text. Additionally, the significant mention that this contributed to the end of the Crusades is omitted. The paraphrase lacks the depth and completeness of the information provided in the original sentence. Therefore, while grammatically correct and using different words to describe the event, the failure to include all vital information and context lowers the quality of the output.",55
"The output successfully captures the original meaning of predicting the likelihood of rain based on visibility of Le Havre's harbor, though it omits the reference to Deauville. The rewording maintains the core idea, replacing 'ياٹ مینوں کو' (yacht owner should keep in mind) with an implicit general suggestion. It shifts 'ذہن میں رکھنا چاہیے' to 'ممکن ہو' (if possible), changing the structure slightly but effectively. Accuracy is maintained in predictions relative to the visibility of the port. There are no grammatical errors, and the synonyms and rephrased elements such as 'نظر نہ آئے' for 'cannot see' are correct. The paraphrase omits explicit reference to 'Deauville' but does not affect the understanding of weather prediction which remains centered around observations from Le Havre.",85
"The output successfully retains the original meaning and key ideas of the input. The paraphrased version changes some words and phrases, using 'یاد رکھوں' instead of 'ذہن میں رکھنا' and 'پتہ چلتا ہے کہ بارش ہو رہی ہے' instead of 'بارش ہو رہی ہے', which maintains the theme of keeping Deauville in mind and predicting rain in Le Havre. There are no grammatical errors in the output. Overall, it efficiently changes the phrasing and words while maintaining the original message.",90
"The paraphrased text significantly simplifies and changes the information by omitting the specific condition involving visibility of Le Havre's port, which was a key part of the original text. This omission changes the specific guidance that was provided in the original text based on the weather conditions and their observation. Additionally, the fact that rain occurs regardless of visibility in the paraphrased text is not mentioned at all. Therefore, while the paraphrased text does talk about the expectation of rain, it fails to retain the original's conditional details. No grammatical errors are present but the key idea isn't fully retained.",30
"The paraphrased text retains the key idea from the original text about weather conditions related to visibility of Le Havre's port. However, it fails to include the entire concept where the original text also mentions that if the port cannot be seen, it is already raining. This exclusion of key information affects the completeness of the message. Furthermore, the new text uses similar structures and terminologies with minor changes in phrasing, fulfilling the criteria of utilizing different words and phrases, albeit minimally. There is no grammatical error in the output.",70
"Output accurately conveys the same meaning as the input while using different wording. The use of 'ہاں، بالکل' for 'ام-ہم' changes the semantic impression slightly from a casual affirmation (somewhat like 'uh-huh') to a more certain and formal affirmation ('Yes, absolutely'). There are no grammatical errors in the output. However, the slight escalation in tone and formality in the output as compared to the original might affect the preciseness of conveying the original casual tone.",90
"Input text 'ام-ہم وہ واقعی ہیں۔' translates to 'Yes, we really are.' The output text 'ہم واقعی ہیں' translates to 'We really are.' The original text seems to include a conversational acknowledgment ('ام-ہم' or 'Yes') that is omitted in the paraphrased output, reducing some context. The main idea conveyed by the phrase 'we really are' is retained. However, the omission of the initial acknowledgment alters the style and slight nuance of the response. Regardless, there are no grammatical errors in the output, and it simplifies the phrasing while mostly preserving the core message. However, it loses some elements of the original.",80
"The output text 'وہ واقعی ہیں۔' has omitted the word 'ام-ہم' from the original input 'ام-ہم وہ واقعی ہیں۔' which may slightly alter the stress or emphasis that was implied by the initial phrase. However, the core meaning of the sentence, which is the assertion of their existence or reality, remains intact. The grammatical integrity is maintained in the output, but the paraphrase is minimal as only the initial word has been dropped and no significant rephrasing is done.",70
"Output has lost some information ('ام-ہم') from the original input, which might affect the intended emphasis or meaning slightly. Moreover, the output retains most of the structure from the input text without using different words or phrases. Therefore, it has a minor issue in retaining all the elements of the original text but does not contain any grammatical errors.",70
"The paraphrased output has successfully retained the original meaning and key ideas of the input, which deals with the concerns of regulators about how financial statements should be presented, their purpose, and their usefulness. The rephrased text uses synonyms and slightly different phrasing without altering the message, such as 'ظاہر کیا جانا چاہیے' changed to 'پیش کیا جانا چاہیے', and 'وہ کتنے مفید ہیں' to 'انکی افادیت کتنی ہے'. Additionally, there are no grammatical errors in the paraphrased text. Therefore, it scores high across all the criteria.",95
"The paraphrased text effectively retains the original meaning by querying the purpose of financial statements, what should be disclosed, and their utility, which are the key concepts presented in the input text. The output restructures the sentence slightly, changing 'مثال کے طور پر، ریگولیٹرز پوچھ رہے ہیں' to 'ریگولیٹرز کے پاس یہ پوچھ رہے ہیں' which still conveys the act of regulators asking questions, but with a slight modification in wording ('کے پاس' is added). A grammatical oversight includes the redundant usage of 'یہ' in the output, which could have been omitted for smoother readability, and 'پوچھ رہے' might be more elegantly replaced with a different verb form. These slight adjustments affect the fluidity but the grammatical structure remains largely correct. The question format is preserved, and critical points are reiterated with slightly altered wording, fulfilling the requirement for varied language.",85
"The output significantly fails to capture the original question posed by the regulators, which encompasses asking what should be disclosed, the purpose of financial statements, and their utility. The paraphrased output only addresses one aspect of the original text ('مالی بیانات کا مقصد کیا ہے'), and incorrectly suggests that 'there is no question about it,' changing the original meaning which was inquiring about these aspects. The output thus lacks comprehensiveness and alters the intent of the query by giving it a conclusive statement rather than preserving the original's inquiry nature. Furthermore, it omits important parts of the original query about the disclosure and utility of financial statements.",20
"The output fails to retain the complete original meaning of the input. The input questions posed by regulators have specific details about what should be disclosed, the purpose of financial statements, and their usefulness which are completely omitted in the output. The output only captures a generalized idea that regulators are asking about financial statements, hence missing key details from the input. Additionally, while the output uses some different vocabulary, the simplification results in a loss of important information and aspects of the inquiry. Thus, the paraphrase is not effective in fulfilling the criteria of retaining original meaning, even though it lacks grammatical errors and uses different words.",30
"The output successfully retains the original meaning expressed in the input, which centers around recognizing the correctness of a statement and acknowledging it as a good point. There are no grammatical errors in the output, and it effectively rearranges the structure while using slightly different wording, maintaining coherence and clarity. The alterations in structure and phraseology such as changing 'آپ شاید صحیح کہہ رہے ہیں' to 'آپ کی بات درست ہو سکتی ہے' demonstrate the use of synonyms and a subtle shift in sentence flow. However, due to close similarity and some word repetition ('اچھی بات'), the variation could have been slightly more diverse.",90
"The output retains the original meaning which is about acknowledging a positive statement or agreement. The phrase 'یہ ایک اچھی بات ہے' is paraphrased to 'یہ ایک مثبت بات ہے', both essentially conveying a positive notion. The rest of the sentence 'آپ شاید صحیح کہہ رہے ہیں' has been changed slightly in the output to 'آپ صحیح کہہ رہے ہو', where 'شاید' (maybe) is omitted, making the statement more affirmative in the output. This slight change does not alter the overall meaning significantly, but it does show the use of different wording while improving or maintaining the essence of the statement. There are no grammatical errors in the output.",90
"The output completely changes the meaning of the input. While the input has a positive connotation and agrees with another viewpoint ('It's a good thing, you are probably right.'), the output expresses a negative perspective and disagreement ('You are wrong, it's a very bad thing.'). Additionally, the paraphrase inverts the tone from positive to negative, hence failing to retain the original meaning and key ideas. The grammatical structure, although correct, does not compensate for the shift in meaning.",10
"The paraphrased output 'آپ غلط ہیں' completely reverses the sentiment of the input 'یہ ایک اچھی بات ہے آپ شاید صحیح کہہ رہے ہیں۔', which suggests agreement or a positive acknowledgment. The output incorrectly translates to 'You are wrong', changing the entire meaning and context of the original statement. Therefore, it fails to retain the original meaning, and uses different words which incorrectly represent the original idea.",0
"The paraphrased output maintains the original meaning of having the same insurance as in Colorado, where the HMO was different and liked by the speaker. However, it somewhat simplifies the expression by omitting the redundant phrase 'جو ابھی ہمارے پاس ہے' which doesn't significantly contribute to the original meaning. The rephrasing like 'وہی بیمہ' instead of 'وہی ہے جو ہمارے پاس بیمہ ہے' and 'جہاں HMO بہت مختلف اور مجھے بہت پسند آیا' instead of 'وہاں ایک مختلف قسم کا HMO تھا جو مجھے واقعی بہت پسند تھا' are notable changes that keep the text fresh while effectively conveying the same message. The grammatical structure in the output is also correct.",95
"The paraphrased text successfully conveys the original message, discussing the same health insurance (HMO) enjoyed in Colorado and still being used by the speaker. It effectively utilizes different words and phrases to restate the idea, showing rephrasing skills while staying true to the message. There are no grammatical issues in the paraphrased text.",95
"The output simplifies and significantly reduces the information presented in the original text. The original text mentions that the specific type of HMO available in Colorado was highly preferred, and the assurance that they still have insurance. The paraphrased text only retains the idea about having a different HMO in Colorado, completely omitting the speaker's preference for that specific HMO type and the fact about currently having insurance. Additionally, there are no grammatical errors in the output, but the reduction in content makes the paraphrase less effective.",60
"The paraphrased text simplifies the original text quite a bit but it loses some essential information. The original mentions that they now have a different insurance from when they were in Colorado where they liked the HMO. The paraphrased version omits the element of the present different insurance they have, focusing solely on the past liking of the HMO in Colorado. This is a significant loss of context and information. Moreover, while the grammar is correct and the wording is somewhat varied, the omission affects the overall integrity of the message.",60
"The output successfully retains the overall meaning and key ideas of the input. The input 'ام-ہم ٹھیک ہے ہاں میں سمجھتا ہوں' translates to 'Mm-hmm okay yes I understand'. The output 'ہاں، میں متفق ہوں، سمجھ گیا ہوں' can be translated as 'Yes, I agree, I have understood'. The retention of the concept of understanding and agreement is evident, although the nuance changes slightly from a more passive 'I understand' to an active 'I have understood'. Additionally, the output has used different wording like 'متفق ہوں' instead of 'ٹھیک ہے' which aligns with the requirement for using different words and phrases. There are no grammatical errors in the paraphrased text.",90
"The output correctly retains the overall meaning of the input, which conveys agreement and understanding. In the paraphrase, 'ہم ٹھیک ہیں' aligns well with the original 'ام-ہم ٹھیک ہے' albeit with a slight grammatical modification adjusting for the correct verb agreement. 'میں سمجھ رہا ہوں' instead of 'ہاں میں سمجھتا ہوں' effectively communicates the same meaning, 'I understand', but slightly rephrased to enhance clarity and fluency. Both sentences reflect effective paraphrasing with varied phrasing while maintaining grammatical correctness.",95
"The output text completely contradicts the original message. The input text expresses affirmation and understanding ('ٹھیک ہے ہاں میں سمجڤتا ہوں' means 'Okay, yes, I understand') while the output negates the understanding, saying 'نہیں، میں اسے نہیں سمجھتا' ('No, I do not understand it'). This inversion of meaning results in a failure to retain the original sentiment or information. Additionally, changing the affirmation to denial goes beyond mere paraphrasing, making the output text not only a poor paraphrase, but also linguistically and contextually inaccurate.",0
"The output has omitted the phrase 'ام-ہم ٹھیک ہے' from the original text. This phrase approximately translates to 'uh-huh, okay' and adds an agreement or acknowledgement before stating the understanding of the speaker. Its removal changes the tone slightly by making the response more direct and less conversational. However, the output retains the core meaning of the original as it still communicates understanding ('ہاں، میں سمجھتا ہوں'). There are no grammatical errors in the output. The use of different words and phrases criterion is not fully met as the main change is the deletion of a part of the text, rather than the paraphrasing of existing words.",70
"The output successfully rephrases the original text while preserving the core meanings. The original sentence talked about men who were already passing by when they stopped running, dressed in masculine attire, and wearing large masks on their faces. While the original text focused on their action (running) and then described their appearance, the output flips this, mentioning their attire and masks first before referencing the action of running. This change in the order of information does not affect the intended meaning. Additionally, the paraphrase maintains grammatical correctness and introduces variations in structure ('مرد پیچھے ہو چکے تھے' vs. 'مرد دوڑنا بند کرنے سے پہلے ہی ان کی پیٹھ سے نکل رہے تھے'), ensuring a fresh presentation of the original ideas.",95
"The output text somewhat captures the main ideas of the original text, but alters the meaning slightly and introduces ambiguity. The original text states that the men were already coming out from behind before they stopped running. The paraphrased text changes this to men starting to come out from their backs, which is not only grammatically awkward in Urdu but also changes the literal scene slightly. Additionally, the nuanced change from 'پہلے ہی' (already) in the original to 'پہلے ہی' (before) in the output distorts the timing and sequence of actions described. However, it retains the element of the men wearing masks and masculine clothing, and the general theme remains recognizable. The grammatical structure is somewhat maintained but tweaked, which leads to a slight awkwardness in readability.",65
"The output simplifies the input to an extreme degree, only retaining that the 'men stopped running.' The rest of the input, which mentions important details about the men wearing masculine attire and having masks covering their faces, is entirely omitted. This results in loss of most of the original meaning and contextual detail needed to understand the scene fully.",20
"The output text has significantly reduced the information from the original input. It does not mention that the men were running, nor does it indicate that they stopped running, both of which are key details in the original text. Additionally, the description of the masks being 'wide' and the attire being 'masculine' has been omitted in the output. The output succinctly notes that the men were wearing masks but fails to retain the full essence and descriptive quality of the original scenario.",40
"The paraphrased output conveys a similar meaning to the original input, though it elaborates slightly. The original input translates to an acknowledgment of a minor misunderstanding, and the output properly enriches this idea without deviating from the core message. Furthermore, the paraphrase uses synonymous expressions like 'اہ-ہہ' changed to 'اوہ' and 'سمجھی کمی' to 'چھوٹی سی غلط فہمی'. These changes show effective use of different words while keeping the same theme. The phrase structures and grammar in the paraphrased text are correct. Thus the paraphrased output retains the original meaning, uses different words and expressions, and is free from grammatical errors.",95
پہلے متن میں جو عبارات استعمال ہوئی ہیں ان میں 'اہ-ہہ ایک سمجھی کمی ویسے بھی ہاں' ہے، جو کچھ غیر واضح اور مبہم ہے لیکن یہ ظاہر کرتا ہے کہ کچھ نقص ہے جو پہچانا گیا ہے۔ دوسرے متن میں تبدیل ہو کر 'یہ ایک اہم کمی ہے جو کچھ اور بھی ہے' بیان کیا گیا ہے، جو مفہوم بنانے میں کچھ زیادہ واضح ہے لیکن اس میں بھی کچھ مبہمی باقی ہے۔ دونوں متنوں میں 'کمی' والا خیال برقرار ہے، اور دوسرے متن میں کچھ دوسرے الفاظ استعمال کیے گئے ہیں لیکن سبکی ابھی بھی ہوسکتی تھی۔,70
"The paraphrased text appears to be a simpler rewording of the original text, and key elements such as 'ایک سمجھی کمی' and 'ہاں' are retained. However, the structure and words used are very similar to those in the original, indicating minimal effort in altering the format or phraseology. This slightly limits the effectivity of the paraphrase in showing creative or varied expression. Although it maintains the essence and meaning, the paraphrase does not fully exploit opportunities to diversify language use.",70
"The output text simplifies the structure of the input but in doing so it loses some integral parts of the original message. The input includes 'ویسے بھی ہاں' which conveys some sort of affirmative or reflective nuance that is completely omitted in the output. Therefore, while the key idea of a 'perceived deficiency' ('سمجھی کمی') is retained, the overall original meaning is partially lost due to the omission of elements. Additionally, the transformation introduces a grammatical structure to make a complete sentence in the output, which is good. However, the lack of key elements affects the quality of the paraphrase significantly, reducing the score.",70
"The output text properly retains the original meaning that someone asked a question quietly from a parrot. The key words like asking the parrot and doing it silently are conveyed. Nonetheless, 'خاموشی سے' meaning 'silently' has been transformed to 'خفیہ طور پر' which means 'secretly' in the paraphrased version. This creates a slight variation in meaning as 'silently' implies a manner of not making sound, whereas 'secretly' implies making an effort not to be known or noticed which could be misunderstood as speaking too softly. There are no grammatical errors in the output, and a variation in wording is present. Hence, adjusting slightly for the nuanced meaning change.",90
"The paraphrased text changes the subject of the sentence from 'I' (میں) to 'me' (مجھے), altering the original meaning. The input expresses an action performed by the speaker ('I asked quietly' - میں نے ... سوال کیا), whereas the output incorrectly portrays the action as being done to the speaker ('asked me quietly' - مجھے ... پوچھا), significantly changing the subject-agent relationship in the sentence. However, the phrase 'quietly' (خاموشی سے) is consistently retained in both versions. The grammatical error in changing the subject and the deviation in meaning affect the quality of the paraphrase.",40
"The output text changes the meaning of the original sentence. In the input, the subject asks a question silently to the parrot, whereas in the output, it is stated that the subject did not ask anything. This significantly alters the key idea and is incorrect in terms of paraphrasing. Additionally, no grammatical errors are present, and different words are used. However, since the main essence and meaning of the text are completely altered, the main criterion for paraphrasing is not met.",20
"The output has slightly altered the original meaning by omitting the word 'خاموشی سے' ('quietly'), which indicates that the question was asked in a quiet manner. This detail is crucial as it provides a context on the manner in which the question was posed, affecting the overall intent and tone of the sentence. Furthermore, the use of words and phrases has not changed much, except for the removal of 'خاموشی سے'. The removal of this phrase leads to a minor loss in specificity but there are no grammatical errors in the output.",80
"The paraphrased output effectively retains the original meaning which is about the United States government's budget for the fiscal year 2002 as derived from historical tables or charts. The structural changes in the sentence slightly enhance clarity and emphasis on temporal context which does not alter the intent of the information. The output transitions 'ریاستہائے متحدہ' to 'امریکی حکومت' which are synonymous, and changes 'تاریخی جدولوں' to 'تاریخی چارٹ', both indicating historical data presentations effectively. There are no grammatical errors, however, the use of 'اس وقت کی' might initially confuse as it introduces a slight deviation in timing context ('at this time') as opposed to the clear historical reference ('original') in the input, but still maintains the overall budget context correctly. Overall, the paraphrase changes words and structure while mostly preserving the original meaning.",90
"The paraphrased output accurately retains the original meaning and key ideas from the input. It discusses the actual and forecasted numbers from the U.S. government budget for the fiscal year 2002, extracted from historical tables. The output rephrases the original sentence without losing any essential information and maintains grammatical accuracy. Additionally, it rearranges the components of the sentence and utilizes synonyms effectively, thus demonstrating the use of different words and phrases. Therefore, the paraphrasing meets all the evaluation criteria effectively.",95
"The output fundamentally alters the message conveyed in the input. The input discusses the source of certain data, stating that 'actual and estimated figures' are from the 'United States government budget, fiscal year 2002, historical tables'. In contrast, the output falsely asserts that the 'United States government budget does not have any actual or estimated figures'. This not only changes the message but presents an inaccurate statement. The significant mismatch in preserving the original information leads to scoring negatively for accuracy of the content.",10
"The output text significantly distorts the original information. The original text provides the information that the actual and projected figures are from the historical tables of the United States government budget for the fiscal year 2002. However, the translated text inaccurately mentions a supposed lack of historical tables in the American government's budget. This represents a shift in meaning and introduces false information, making it a poor paraphrase of the original text.",10
"The paraphrased text retains the original meaning effectively. The phrases 'آرٹس اور دستکاری' and 'فنون و دستکاری' both translate to 'arts and crafts,' demonstrating appropriate use of synonyms. The phrase 'بڑے احترام سے منعقد کیا جاتا ہے' is changed to 'کی بڑی قدر کی جاتی ہے,' which successfully maintains the meaning related to high respect or value. There are no grammatical errors in the output, and the use of different words to convey the same meaning is evident which shows a good level of paraphrasing while keeping the original context intact.",95
"The output text has minimal modification compared to the input text and only changes one word ('بڑے' to 'بہت') which doesn't significantly alter the phrase structure or vocabulary of the original sentence. The output retains the original meaning and the grammatical structure is preserved. However, the paraphrasing lacks creativity and diversity in terms of vocabulary and sentence structure.",30
"The output text is identical to the input text, showing no use of different words or phrases. While it retains the original meaning and has no grammatical errors, it fails in the aspect of paraphrasing as there is no alteration or rephrasing of the original sentence.",40
"The output preserves the original meaning of the input, which is about the respectful organization of arts and crafts in Edinburgh. However, the change from 'بڑے' to 'بہت' in the paraphrase does not significantly alter the sentence, as both adverbs convey a similar intensity of respect ('great' respect). This minor change does not meet the criterion of using different words and phrases effectively. Additionally, there are no grammatical errors in the output.",65
پیرافریز کیا گیا متن اصلی متن کے مفہوم کو برقرار رکھتا ہے، جسمیں بار بار انتباہ ملنے کے بعد کسی ریاست کو غلط حکومت چلانے کے قصوروار کے قرار دیئے جانے اور پیراماؤنٹ پاور کے طور پر انگریزوں دوارا اس ریاست کو اپنے انتظام میں شامل کر لیے جانے کا ذکر ہے۔ اصلی اور پیرافریز شدہ متن میں الفاظ گر جائز ہے، لیکن اس میں زور اور تنقید برقرار رکھی گئی ہے۔ گرامر کی سطح پر بھی کوئی خطا موجود نہیں ہے۔ مجموعی طور پر، پیرافریز کردہ متن اصل کے مطابق ہے اور اس کا مفہوم بھی واضح طور پر پیش کرتا ہے۔,98
"The output paraphrased text successfully alters the sentence structure but makes errors in maintaining coherence and clarity. The phrase 'پیراماؤنٹ پاور' has been rephrased to 'پاور انگریزوں کی' which changes the original emphasis on Paramount power being a distinct entity to it being just a description of power. This alteration slightly shifts the meaning, reducing clarity on the original's emphasis. Also, the repetition of 'انگریزوں' is unnecessary and introduces redundancy, affecting the fluidity of the text. No grammatical errors are visible but the paraphrasing fails slightly on maintaining the original message.",70
"The output text retains the core idea from the input which discusses a state being guilty of misgovernance and consequently associated with the British paramount power. However, the output significantly simplifies the context by omitting the condition 'after repeated warnings', which is crucial to understanding the circumstances leading to the conclusion. This omission affects the richness and preciseness of the original expression. Additionally, the phrase 'پیراماؤنٹ پاور انگریزوں نے' is condensed to 'انگریزوں نے' in the output, losing the reference to 'paramount power,' which has a specific historical connotation. Therefore, while the output uses different words and structures, and there are no grammatical errors, it significantly dials down the depth and specificity expressed in the input.",70
"The output has maintained some of the key ideas from the input, such as the action of British labeling a state for wrong governance. However, the output omits significant details originally present such as repeated warnings and the idea of incorporating the state with paramount power by the British. This omission alters the depth and implications of the statement. Additionally, the sentence structure and phrasing are not sufficiently altered from the original text, which affects the paraphrasing criteria of using different words and phrases. Lastly, there are no grammatical errors in the output.",65
"The output successfully retains the original meaning which discusses the standard (success or failure) used by news agencies to evaluate policies, rather than right or wrong. The paraphrase also maintains clear Urdu grammar, ensuring coherent structure and readability. Moreover, it effectively uses different words and phrases, such as 'پرکھنے کے لئے' instead of 'جائزہ لینے میں', and 'استعمال کرتے ہیں' instead of 'محسوس کرتے ہیں', while maintaining the core ideas presented in the original text.",95
"The output maintains the original meaning by discussing how news agencies feel about the success or failure of a policy when reviewing it. However, the rephrasing slightly changes the focus from the ease of review ('آسانی محسوس کرتے ہیں' to 'محسوس کرتی ہے') and omits mentioning the specific standard or criterion mentioned in the input ('واحد معیار'). The grammar in the output is correct and different words and phrases have been used. However, the omission of the reference to the 'standard' reduces the fidelity of paraphrasing to the original message.",70
"The output significantly changes the original meaning of the input text. The original text states the criteria through which news agencies find it easier to evaluate a policy, emphasizing the dichotomy of 'success or failure', not 'right or wrong'. However, the output simply mentions that news agencies evaluate policies, omitting the critical details about the criteria of evaluation based on 'success or failure' versus 'right or wrong'. This changes the core message and context. Additionally, the use of different words and phrases is minimal and fails to maintain the integrity and depth of the original message.",20
"The output text significantly misses the original meaning by omitting the entire idea about the standard used by news agencies to assess policies, specifically mentioning 'success or failure' versus 'right or wrong.' This simplifies the message so much that the crucial component regarding evaluation criteria is left out, leading to a change in the original context and meaning. Additionally, while grammatical errors are absent, the lack of adherence to the original content and insufficient use not only of different wording but also of complete ideas leads to a less effective paraphrase.",20
"The paraphrased output has perfectly retained the original meaning, which is asking for a preference between light or deep green. The construction of the phrase has been slightly altered by repeating the word 'سبز' for each adjective, which provides an emphasis on the color green. Although the alteration is minimal, it still introduces a bit of redundancy which wasn't present in the original but maintains the clarity and focus on the choices. There are no grammatical errors in the output.",95
اس کی تشریح میں بنیادی معنی برقرار ہیں، کیونکہ دونوں جملے پوچھ رہے ہیں کہ آیا سبز کا کون سا رنگ ترجیح دی جائے، ہلکا یا گہرا۔ تاہم، زیادہ بدلنے کی جگہ صرف دوسرے حصے میں 'سبز' کا اضافہ کیا گیا ہے، جو کہ تبدیلی کے زمرے میں بہت کم ہے لیکن واضح ہے۔ کوئی گرامر کی خطا موجود نہیں ہے۔,90
موجودہ آؤٹ پٹ میں 'سبز' کا لفظ غائب ہے، جو کہ اصلی متن کا ایک اہم جزو ہے اور اصل معنی کی پوری طور پر نمائندگی کرتا ہے۔ اس لفظ کے غیب ہونے سے افادیت میں کمی آتی ہے اور وضاحت میں کمزوری پیدا ہوتی ہے کیونکہ 'ہلکا یا گہرا' کا جملہ اکیلا کوئی مخصوص موضوع دار نہیں ہے اور کسی بھی چیز کے سیاق میں استعمال ہو سکتا ہے۔,30
"The output text is an exact copy of the input text without any changes, which fails the criteria for using different words and phrases. However, it perfectly retains the original meaning and has no grammatical errors. Since the requirement to use different words and phrases is not met, the score must be significantly reduced.",40
"The output text successfully retains the original meaning and key ideas of the input text, which emphasize the necessity of effective information technology management for reliable and consistent recording and communication of information. There are no grammatical errors in the paraphrased text. Additionally, the output employs different words and phrases, such as using 'موثر طریقے سے درست، معتبر اور باقاعدہ طور پر' instead of 'مفید، قابل بھروسہ، اور مسلسل', and 'بہتر انتظام' instead of 'موثر انفارمیشن ٹیکنالوجی کا انتظام'. This demonstrates an adept use of language to convey the same ideas with different terminology.",95
"The paraphrased text maintains the original text's essence about the necessity of effective management of information technology for acquiring reliable, continuous recording and communication of information. However, the sentence structure in the output has been altered to enhance clarity and readability, using phrases like 'کے ذریعے' and restructuring the order of phrases while keeping the same key terms and ideas. Both the input and output texts are grammatically correct and convey the message clearly. The paraphrased version accomplishes the goal of using different wording without distorting the original meaning, making it a successful paraphrase.",90
"The output text has significantly reduced the content of the original text. It only retains the latter part, ""انفارمیشن ٹیکنالوجی کا انتظام بہت ضروری ہے۔"" which translates to ""It is very necessary to manage information technology."" However, the output omits the purpose and details specified in the original text about the role of information technology in ensuring the acquisition of 'useful, reliable, and continuous recording and communication'. This omission changes the specificity and richness of the information conveyed, thereby failing criterion 1 (Retains the original meaning and key ideas). The output is grammatically correct, satisfying criterion 2. Regarding criterion 3, the output does not use different words or phrases effectively, as it simply truncates parts of the original sentence without paraphrasing the retained portion significantly.",30
"Output text has omitted the descriptors 'useful' and 'reliable' (مفید، قابل بھروسہ) that were used in the input to describe the information. While it retains the general idea about the necessity of effective IT management for the continuous recording and communication of information, the exclusion of these qualities affects the completeness of the paraphrasing. Grammar is correctly maintained, and slightly different words and phrases are used. However, the loss of certain key adjectives reduces the overall quality of the information conveyed.",75
"The output retains the original meaning very effectively. It explains that drinking was not a problem since planning for each child was done and it seemed like he was the one who wanted to start the family. This explanation is consistent with the input meaning. Furthermore, the output rephrases several parts of the sentence, using phrases like 'نہیں تھا' instead of 'کوئی مسئلہ نہیں تھا' and 'وہ خود بچوں کی پیدائش کے عمل کا آغاز کرنے والا تھا' instead of 'وہ وہی ہے جس نے بچے پیدا کرنے کی شروعات کی تھی'. This effectively uses different words and constructs to communicate the same idea. There are no grammatical errors in the output, ensuring a smooth and correct use of the Urdu language.",95
"The output retains the original meaning of addressing alcoholism as a problem and planning for each child. It also preserves the inference about one person initiating childbearing and thus wanting 'M'. However, the transformation about alcoholism not allowing any grievances is a slight deviation but not significant enough to lose the main idea. There is also a natural flow and appropriate use of vocabulary which are different but synonymous to the original words like 'مشکل معاملہ' instead of 'مسئلہ', and 'پلاننگ' instead of 'منصوبہ بندی'. The grammatical structure is correctly maintained.",90
"The paraphrased text does not accurately retain the original meaning of the input. The input suggests a discussion about planned parenthood and implies there was a dedication towards having children, referring to a child as something specifically wanted. The output, however, just mentions an attempt to have a child that was unsuccessful, which changes the context significantly and omits details about the planning and desire involved. There are no grammatical errors in the output, but it drastically differs in key ideas and does not convey the same narrative as the input.",30
"The output has greatly reduced the content of the original text, removing multiple key ideas such as the mention of drinking being a problem, any dissatisfaction, and the particular implication that 'he' initiated having children. This simplifies the text too much and loses essential components of the narrative, which significantly alters the original meaning. Additionally, the complex relationship suggested in the original sentence about planning and desires regarding having children is omitted. Therefore, while there are no grammatical errors and different words are used, the failure to retain the original content affects the score negatively.",30
"The output retains the original meaning by mentioning that the Grizedale Visitor and Wildlife Center has information and a map concerning 75 statues, which can be seen by visitors. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation. Additionally, the paraphrased sentence uses different phrases like 'معلومات اور نقشہ موجود ہیں' instead of 'نقشے اور معلومات ہیں' and also slightly tweaks the structure, though the change in structure ('جو زائرین کو دکھائے جاتے ہیں' instead of directly 'زائرین وائلڈ لینڈ میں دیکھ سکتے ہیں') slightly alters the original emphasis on visitor observation. Overall, it still communicates the same vital information effectively.",90
"The paraphrased output retains the original meaning of the input well. Both the input and output focus on Grizedale Visitor and Wildlife Centre having maps and information, specifically about 75 sculptures visible in the wild land. Additionally, there are no grammatical errors in the output. The paraphraser has effectively used different phrasing, changing 'کے پاس نقشے اور معلومات ہیں' to 'میں زائرین کو مجسموں کے نقشے اور معلومات دی جاتی ہیں,' which shows a subtle shift in sentence structure while retaining the message. This output satisfactorily meets the required criteria.",95
"The output simplifies and distorts the original text significantly. While it retains the information about '75 sculptures' being visible to visitors in the wildland, it entirely omits the context provided by the 'Grizedale Visitor and Wildlife Center' possessing maps and information. It also leaves out that these maps and information specifically relate to the sculptures. This omission alters the comprehension of where and how the visitors can find these sculptures. Additionally, the restructuring in the output doesn't maintain the essence of the original message, causing loss of critical information.",40
"The output is an exact repetition of the input text without any changes in words, phrases, or structure. Therefore, it fails to meet the criteria of using different words and phrases. However, it retains the original meaning completely and contains no grammatical errors.",40
"The paraphrased text adequately retains the original meaning and nuances effectively. Although the structure of the sentence in the output has been altered, it still conveys the same sense of uncertainty and ambivalence as expressed in the input. Specifically, both the input and output reflect a response to possibly agreeing with someone named 'Dorcas.' The addition of 'میں ابھی اس بات کا تعین نہیں کر سکتا' ('I can't determine this yet') in the output introduces extra detail while preserving the original's hesitancy conveyed through 'ہاں، نہیں، ابھی نہیں' ('yes, no, not now'). There are no grammatical errors in the output, and different words and phrases are successfully employed to convey the same idea, which enhances the paraphrasing quality.",95
"The output does not retain the exact meaning of the input. The input directly states a possibility of agreement with a hint of indecision ('ہاں، نہیں، ابھی نہیں'), implying ambiguity in agreement at that time. However, the output introduces a new element ('لیکن ابھی نہیں کہہ سکتا'), which shifts the meaning to an inability to confirm agreement at that moment, rather than the indecision suggested in the original. This shift slightly alters the intended meaning. In terms of language use, different phrases are used in the paraphrase ('میرے ساتھ اتفاق رکھ رہے' versus 'ٹھیک کہہ رہے ہو'), which reflects an effective paraphrase. However, the grammatical structure and clarity remain correct. Therefore, while the paraphrasing shows reasonable lexical variety and grammar, it slightly misinterprets the original sentiment.",75
"The paraphrased output retains the original meaning of uncertainty and acknowledgment effectively. The original text discusses indecision with 'ہاں، نہیں، ابھی نہیں', which has been succinctly captured in the paraphrase with 'لیکن ابھی تک نہیں'. The conversion from 'تم' to 'آپ' shows a subtle and respectful shift in language use, thus indicating use of different words while keeping the essence. There are no grammatical errors in the output. The paraphrase maintains the core idea and revolves around an expression of agreeing but with an element of hesitation or delay, which aligns well with the source. Therefore, the paraphrase is good.",90
"The output has deviated significantly from the original meaning of the input text. The original sentence, 'شاید تم ٹھیک کہہ رہے ہو، ڈورکاس، ہاں، نہیں، ابھی نہیں۔,' suggests a sense of uncertainty or consideration ('شاید' means 'perhaps' or 'maybe') about Dorcas' statement being correct, along with an indecisive response ('ہاں، نہیں، ابھی نہیں' translates to 'yes, no, not now'). However, the output 'ڈورکاس، آپ غلط ہیں، ہاں، ابھی نہیں۔' incorrectly translates into a definite disagreement ('آپ غلط ہیں' means 'you are wrong') without capturing the original's uncertainty and nuanced agreement. Furthermore, the structure of the sentence is grammatically correct but fails to maintain a consistent message or mood. The paraphrasing is thus not only inaccurate in translating the original message but also changes the meaning entirely.",20
"The output text retains the original meaning of the input text very well, capturing the context of successful bankers increasing the wealth of their trusted investors behind plain, painted doors. The choice of words has been slightly altered while keeping the overall message intact. 'مضبوط' has been replaced with 'مستحکم', and 'پینٹ شدہ دروازوں' has been changed to 'پینٹ کیے گئے دروازے'. Additionally, 'قابل اعتماد' is slightly adjusted to 'بھروسے مند', and 'اضافہ کیا' was changed to 'بڑھائی'. These changes keep the essence and continuity of the content while varying the phrasing, thus achieving effective paraphrasing. The sentence is grammatically correct and follows the structural norms of the Urdu language.",95
"The paraphrased output retains the original meaning by indicating that behind strong, simple, painted doors, numerous successful bankers have enhanced the wealth of their trusted investors. The use of 'کئی کامیاب بینکر' instead of 'بہت سے کامیاب بینکروں' and 'کر چکے ہیں' instead of 'کیا' shows a variation in phrasing which maintains the original message while incorporating different word choices. There are no grammatical errors, and the altered phrases maintain the consistency and quality of the original sentence.",95
"The output simplifies the input but omits some critical elements that are essential for retaining the full original meaning. The phrase 'مضبوط، سادہ، پینٹ شدہ دروازوں کے پیچھے' which adds a layer of security and privacy context to the action of the bankers, is entirely missing in the output. Furthermore, the output also switches to a more general tone by omitting details about the success of the bankers. Although grammatically correct, the lack of detail and scene-setting information significantly diminishes the richness and precision of the original message. The rephrasing does use different words and adjusts the structure but fails crucially on preserving the original scene and contextual depth.",40
"The paraphrased text slightly shifts the meaning of the original sentence. The original text specifies 'مضبوط، سادہ، پینٹ شدہ دروازوں کے پیچھے' (behind strong, simple, painted doors), which adds important context implying secrecy or discretion in the operations of these successful bankers, which is omitted in the paraphrased output. Additionally, the original mentioned 'بہت سے کامیاب بینکروں' (many successful bankers) whereas the paraphrased text reduces this to 'تمام کامیاب بینکرز' (all successful bankers), which inaccurately generalizes the statement. There are no grammatical errors, but the paraphrase does not effectively use different words to retain the precise original meaning.",70
"The output text manages to retain the original meaning of the input text effectively. Both sentences confirm something is different and refer to the handing over of a piece of paper. The change from 'اس کے حوالے کی' to 'ان کو دی' modifies the phrasing but retains the core idea of giving a paper slip. Additionally, the word 'ایک' is introduced in the output for emphasis, and 'کاغذ کی پرچی' is changed to 'کاغذی پرچی', demonstrating effective use of synonym. Moreover, there are no grammatical errors in the modified text. Overall, the paraphrasing maintains the content and structure while adequately varying terminology and construction.",95
"In the given output, there is some alteration in wording but it leads to a slight shift in meaning from the original text. In the original text, the paper slip is being handed over to someone else, whereas in the paraphrased version, the subject keeps the paper slip for themselves, altering the intended action and recipient. This changes the original meaning. Besides, the word 'مختلف' meaning 'different' has been changed to 'جدا' meaning 'distinct' or 'separate', which, although conveying a similar idea, implies slightly different nuances. There are no noticeable grammatical errors in the output.",65
"The output text only includes the second sentence from the original input, completely omitting the first sentence ('نہیں , یہ ایک مختلف ہے'). Therefore, it fails to retain the complete original meaning and key ideas, as it excludes the concept indicated by 'یہ ایک مختلف ہے', which significantly changes the context. The output does not introduce any grammatical errors but also does not use different words or phrases since it exactly replicates part of the original text. Hence, the paraphrase quality is poor.",30
"The output has failed to include the part of the input 'نہیں , یہ ایک مختلف ہے .', thus leaving out a significant portion of the original text which affects the preservation of the full meaning. Although the sentence in the output is grammatically correct and matches the grammatical structure of the part it does include, it only reproduces the second sentence of the input without any paraphrasing. The original meaning from the first sentence is completely missing, and because the output mirrors exactly what is in the second part of the original, it does not use different words or phrases to express the same idea. Therefore, it fails in both retaining the original full meaning and using different wording.",10
"The paraphrased text effectively retains the original meaning and ideas about stars moving in the sky and the unity around the world, as well as Dave grumbling about his own foolishness. The translation has successfully used different words such as 'شانتی سے' (peacefully) instead of 'ساتھ' (with), and 'چلتے ہیں' (move) instead of 'حرکت کرتے ہیں' (move), which are appropriate and enhance the sentence structures. Additionally, the phrase 'شکایت کی' (complained) is used instead of 'بڑبڑایا' (murmured/grumbled) which carries a similar but not identical meaning. This shows a good use of synonyms to convey the same idea. There are no grammatical errors in the output.",95
"The paraphrased text retains the original meaning effectively. Both sentences convey that stars move in union across the world with the sky, and that Dave muttered about his foolishness. The phrase 'اتحاد کے طور پر' was switched to 'اتحاد کے لئے' in the paraphrase, maintaining the meaning while changing the word structure slightly. The grammatical structure remains correct, and the slight modification in linking the two phrases (use of 'لیکن' added for 'but') provides a smooth transition while introducing a connector not present in the original. Overall, the paraphrase keeps the essence and structure while making minor word changes.",92
"The output misses essential details from the original text. It loses the context that the stars are moving in unison with the entire world, and completely omits the quote about Dave muttering about his foolishness. This paraphrase significantly alters the original meaning by removing key elements of the message.",40
"The original text provides a description of the stars moving in unison with the sky and includes a quoted statement where 'Dave mutters about his stupidity'. The output, however, omits the part about Dave muttering about his stupidity and instead changes it to Dave stating the movement of stars. This alters the context significantly as it removes the aspect of Dave's self-criticism, and portrays him as merely stating a fact about stars, thereby losing the original meaning and emotional tone. Moreover, the output slightly paraphrases the description of the stars' movement but does not provide adequate differentiation in terms of vocabulary or phrasing from the original text. The grammatical structure of the output is correct.",50
"The paraphrased text retains the original meaning effectively, conveying the same incident of Baarik and Kaadan and the moment a shining tip is seen. The original term 'ریپیر' (rapier) is appropriately paraphrased to 'تلوار' (sword) which keeps the sense intact while providing a slight variation. Likewise, the phrases 'مڑ گیا' is turned to 'نے موڑ نہ لیا', changing the construction but preserving the narrative element of turning/movement. The final part regarding the visual of the silver shining tip retains its descriptive quality. There are no grammatical errors in the paraphrased sentence, and different words are effectively used while ensuring the meaning remains unchanged.",95
"The output translation changes the detail that the shiny tip of the rapier was emerging from the chest of 'Barik' in the original text, to it emerging from the chest of 'Kadan' in the translated text. This misrepresents the actions in the scene. Although the words used slightly differ in each sentence, the key ideas and actions have been inaccurately translated, affecting the overall meaning.",40
"The output has significantly simplified and altered the original message. The input narrates an event in a descriptive manner - mentioning the disappearance of the Reaper, a specific moment during an action (turning point), and the presence of another character, Kaadan, observing a gleaming silver tip emerging from Barrik's chest. The output, however, omits all these details except for the emergence of the silver tip. It simplifies the act to Barrik himself pulling out the silver tip, which changes the original narrative's subject and the sequence of actions involving multiple characters and events. This omission and alteration of key elements result in a substantial change in the original meaning conveyed.",25
"The output successfully paraphrases the original text by changing sentence structure and some words, yet fully preserving its meaning. Both texts describe Bariek's experience of losing his rapier and the sighting of a silvery tip emerging from his chest, although the order in which things are presented and the exact phrasing are altered. The output also retains accurate grammatical structure, contributing to its high score.",90
"The output text has maintained the original meaning of the input, which is about someone being labeled as a criminal. The phrase 'قرار پائے ہیں' in the output implies a conclusion or declaration, similar to 'ہیں' in the input but with a slightly more formal tone, which might enhance the interpretation slightly. There are no grammatical errors in the output. Additionally, the structure is modified ('اب وہ' instead of 'وہ اب') and new words like 'قرار پائے' have been used, which shows effective use of different words while retaining the original meaning.",95
"The paraphrased output accurately retains the original meaning, which is about someone now being identified or considered as a criminal. The change from 'وہ اب مجرم ہیں' (They are now criminals) to 'انہیں اب مجرم قرار دیا گیا ہے' (They have now been declared criminals) keeps the main idea intact, while using different phrasing and structure. There are no grammatical errors in the output. The use of 'قرار دیا گیا ہے' instead of simply 'ہیں' introduces a passive construction which offers a variation in sentence structure.",95
"The output 'وہ مجرم ہیں' closely reflects the input 'وہ اب مجرم ہیں' but omits the word 'اب' which conveys 'now.' This omission changes the meaning slightly, suggesting a general state of being a criminal rather than specifying a change to that state. However, it retains the general idea that 'they are criminals.' There are no grammatical errors, and the word choice, albeit similar, has been minimally altered due to the shortness of the text. More variation in phrasing could improve the paraphrase quality in a longer text.",80
"The output is an exact copy of the input text, which indicates no effort in paraphrasing at all. There was no use of different words or phrases. However, the output retains the original meaning and has no grammatical errors because it is identical to the input. The paraphrasing requirement of using different wording was not met.",30
"The output accurately retains the original meaning of the input text while using a synonym ('کرنٹ اکاؤنٹ' in place of 'چیکنگ اکاؤنٹ') and slightly altering the sentence structure (adding 'موجود ہے'). Both versions discuss the existence of a type of bank account, which is conceptually captured correctly in the paraphrase. The use of 'موجود ہے' adds a bit more formality to the statement, aligning well with the context and enhancing readability. No grammatical errors are present in the output.",97
"The output has retained the original meaning and key idea fully, as it still communicates that there is a checking account present. It has made only a minor alteration by adding 'موجود' which translates to 'present' or 'available', adding slightly to the emphasis of the statement but not substantially changing the phrasing. There are no grammatical errors in the output text. However, the use of different words and phrases in the paraphrased text is minimal, indicating a lack of substantial rephrasing, which reduces the quality of paraphrasing in terms of lexical diversity.",60
"The paraphrased output has merely omitted the initial phrase 'یہاں تک کہ' from the input text which does not significantly change or enhance the text in terms of paraphrasing quality. The core information remains the same; however, the omission does not display the use of different terminology or rephrased structure, which is essential in paraphrasing. The grammatical integrity is maintained in the output, yet the absence of originality in terms of wording or phrase reconstruction results in a lower score.",60
"The output text is identical to the input text with no changes in words or phrases. The paraphrasing criteria is not met as there’s no use of different words or phrase alterations. Therefore, even though the content retains its original meaning and has no grammatical errors, it fails in the requirement of paraphrasing.",30
"The output adequately preserves the original content and structure but minimally rephrases the format, making slight improvements for clarity by using commas to separate the sections instead of repeating the word 'ضمیمہ' for each section. However, there is minimal transformation or use of different phrases; the list format and much of the terminology remains the same as in the input. While there are no grammatical errors in the output, the lack of significant paraphrasing beyond formatting adjustments results in a moderate score.",70
"The paraphrased text maintains the original content which lists various appendix sections along with their page numbers. It successfully retains all the key information such as the objectives, scope, procedures, economic model, key assumptions, dictionary, bibliography, and related GAO products, along with their respective page numbers. The language used in the output is slightly different, introducing phrases like 'شامل ہیں’ and reformatting how page numbers are listed, which enhances readability without changing the essence. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu text provided in the output.",95
"The output does not adequately represent the content from the input. The input appears to be a contents list of a document or book with various appendix sections listed by topic and page numbers. However, the output only mentions one of these sections broadly ('اقتصادی ماڈل اور کلیدی مفروضے'), omitting all others including their specific details or page numbers. Furthermore, it only states that the appendix is related to the economic model and key assumptions, which does not comprehensively paraphrase or reflect the range of topics indicated in the original input. Therefore, the output loses significant information and context, making it a poor paraphrase.",15
"The output provided appears to only reference the abbreviation 'ضمیمہ اقتصادی ماڈل اور کلیدی مفروضے' from the original detailed input, which lists several appendix sections along with their page numbers. The original input specifies different appendices and their corresponding content details including objectives, the scope and procedures, economic model and key assumptions, a glossary, bibliography, and related GAO (General Accounting Office) products along with specific page numbers. The output does not retain the original meaning completely as it significantly reduces the details by only mentioning the economic models and key assumptions without referring to the other contents listed. Hence, the paraphrase does not faithfully reproduce or allude to the omitted sections of the original content such as the objectives, glossary, and bibliography. Additionally, while the language use in the output seems grammatically correct, it does not adequately capture the diversity and specificity of the input.",20
"The paraphrased text successfully retains the original meaning, focusing on the annual participation in the lottery and the memorization of the last three digits of a document number similar to one's social security number. It has no grammatical errors, and uses different words and phrases from the original text to convey the same ideas. Overall, the paraphrase is effective and clear.",95
"The output retains the original meaning expressed in the input about participating in a lottery annually and knowing the last three digits of a document as combined with other numbers. The paraphrase modifies phrases smoothly, 'اس پوری بڑی لاٹری' is slightly shortened to 'اس پوری لاٹری,' and 'جو آپ جانتے ہیں جیسے آپ کا سوشل سیکیورٹی نمبر آپ کو دوسرے نمبروں کے ساتھ ملایا گیا ہے' has been effectively simplified to 'جو آپ کو دوسرے نمبروں کے ساتھ ملے ہوئے ہیں.' Moreover, grammatical integrity is maintained throughout the paraphrasing process. Overall, it effectively employs alternate words and phrasing while clearly conveying the original intent and details.",95
"The output significantly changes the original meaning of the input text. While the input explains the process of participating in a big lottery annually and knowing the last three digits of a document compared to a social security number, the output incorrectly simplifies the information by stating that the social security number is included in the lottery numbers. This alteration leaves out the context about the annual participation and the specific reference to the last three digits. Additionally, the informative comparison involving other numbers is missing. Therefore, while grammatically the output is fine, it fails in retaining the original message and key idea.",30
"The output simplifies the original input but omits some details which affects the overall meaning slightly. The original mentions knowing the last three digits of a document as if knowing one's social security number, which is not clearly reflected in the output. The output is grammatically correct and uses different phrases than the original, such as omitting the details about the 'last three digits of the document.' However, the deletion of these details can be seen as a reduction in specificity, which loosely affects the retention of the complete idea.",75
"The output maintains the original meaning of the input: both describe the same action of 'Ca'daan' leaving 'Fena Dim' as the red sun colored the horizon in shades reminiscent of ribbons or a sketch of an old one. The paraphrase uses different words to describe the scenery and action (e.g., 'افق پر اپنا خاکہ بنایا' instead of 'سرخ رنگ کے ربنوں میں پرانے والے کا خاکہ پینٹ کیا'), effectively changing the textual structure while keeping the essence. The text has no grammatical errors, maintaining a grammatically correct structure in Urdu.",95
"The output retains the overall meaning from the original text, where both mention Ca'daan leaving Fena Dim when the red sun painted the outline of something old in red ribbons. However, the output rearranges the phrase about the 'red ribbons', placing it at the end and introducing a slight ambiguity by separating it from direct mention with the sun which slightly hinders the flow and imagery compared to the original. There are no grammatical errors in the output, but the paraphrasing is minimal and the restructuring of the elements does not add clarity or enhance the sentence. The essence is retained, but the impact is slightly reduced by the new arrangement.",75
"The original text includes a poetic depiction of the time and setting by mentioning the red sun casting hues 'سرخ رنگ کے ربنوں' and how it painted an outline of the ruins 'پرانے والے کا خاکہ'. The paraphrased output 'Ca'daan Fena Dim سے دور چلا گیا' simplifies the scene by stating only that Ca'daan left Fena Dim without the atmospheric detail or the specific illustration of time provided by the sun’s condition and color effects in the original text. Due to this, the paraphrase loses substantial integral artistic detail that not only sets the tone but also enriches the context. Thus, while the output does capture the basic action described in the input, it strips away important and colorful poetic elements. There aren't any grammatical issues with the output, but it fails to use a variety of phrases or different wording for the remaining elements, which are, however, vastly simplified.",45
"The output has omitted some crucial descriptive details from the original sentence. The specific phrase 'سرخ رنگ کے ربنوں میں' (in ribbons of red color) was excluded in the output, which lessens the vividness and specific imagery of 'the old one being painted by the red sun', altering the atmospheric quality in the sentence. While grammatical errors are absent, and both sentences are structurally sound, the omission of key descriptive elements affects how well the original meaning and atmosphere are conveyed.",70
"The original text and the paraphrased text both convey the same idea that something should be a bit colder. However, the slight variation in expression ('اوہ اچھا' changed to 'اوہ ٹھیک ہے' and 'ہونا چاہئے' changed to 'ہو جانے دو') indicates effective use of different words while maintaining the original meaning. There are no grammatical errors in the output text. Therefore, the paraphrased text successfully retains the original meaning, uses different wording, and is grammatically correct.",95
"The paraphrased text maintains the original meaning of the input, which is about something being 'a bit cold'. However, in the paraphrase, the phrase order is slightly restructured but retains all original elements. The paraphrase introduces a slight change from 'اوہ' to 'وہ', which doesn't affect the meaning significantly, but 'وہ' typically refers to 'that' and 'اوہ' is more of an interjection like 'oh'. Furthermore, the construction of 'یا تھوڑا سا' might confuse the syntax slightly, deviating from the standard expression by repeating the idea of 'a bit' at the end instead of fostering a natural flow. There are no grammatical errors, although the sentence could be more natural in flow.",85
"The output text is almost identical to the input text, with the only difference being the addition of a comma and a full stop for punctuation. This change does not qualify as paraphrasing since the words and phrases remain the same and no new words or structures are introduced. Therefore, although the grammatical quality is fine and it retains the original meaning, it fails in terms of using different words and phrases.",10
"The output maintains the meaning of the original text which communicates the need for something to be a bit cold. However, the phrase 'اوہ اچھا' in the original text is omitted in the translated version. This phrase can imply acknowledgment or realization, adding an additional layer to the expression that is lost in the paraphrasing. While the rephrased sentence uses slightly different structures, it lacks creativity in paraphrasing as it repeats most words from the input. There are no grammatical errors in the output.",70
"The paraphrased output quite effectively retains the original meaning of the input while using different words to express the same thoughts. The original sentence talks about having the knowledge to continue something, and this remains unchanged in the paraphrase. Additionally, the paraphrase introduces small changes such as replacing 'ایسا نہیں ہے' with 'معاملہ یہ نہیں' and 'برقرار رہتا ہے' with 'قائم رہتا ہے', which essentially convey the same meaning but with slightly different wording, which shows good use of synonyms and phrasing. Furthermore, there are no grammatical errors in the output, which makes it a high-quality paraphrase.",95
"The paraphrased output maintains the original meaning which is regarding the continuity of something despite lack of further knowledge. The change of 'لیکن' in the first part to 'لہذا' does not alter the meaning significantly and still fits the context. The sentence structure and grammatical correctness are preserved. Also, the change of words was minimal and could have been more varied to demonstrate better paraphrasing skills. Hence, the paraphrasing is decent but not very creative.",80
"The output has significantly reduced the length of the original text, omitting key information that is essential to maintaining the original meaning. The original input discusses a continuous process or situation and explicitly states that 'it's not like you don't know anything else to continue,' implying knowledge or methods are available to keep it ongoing. However, the output only captures the latter idea of something being sustained or maintained ('یہ واقعی برقرار رہتا ہے'). It drops critical components about knowledge or methods to continue the process, thereby failing to preserve the complete thought and meaning expressed in the input. Additionally, since much of the information is lost, we can't evaluate its grammaticality or use of different phrases fully.",30
"The input and output texts are essentially the same with minor reordering of clauses, and no significant changes in words or phrases. While the output is grammatically correct and retains the original meaning, the lack of introduction of different vocabulary or restructuring reduces the quality of paraphrasing. Therefore, the score is primarily affected by the lack of adequate paraphrasing.",45
"The paraphrased output accurately captures the original meaning, which emphasizes the requirement of training and monitoring in the imposition of quality controls for several sites involved with the implementation of a program. The output has no grammatical errors and utilizes different words to convey the same message, such as using 'عموماً' instead of 'عام طور پر', 'نافذ کرنے کے لئے' instead of 'کے نفاذ کے سوالات کے لیے', and 'شرائط' instead of 'مطالبات'. The changes in phraseology and structure also demonstrate a proficient use of Urdu language norms in paraphrasing.",95
"The paraphrased text does a good job of retaining the original meaning, which revolves around sites generally imposing demands for training and monitoring for quality control for the implementation of a program. The key concepts of 'مطالبات عائد کرتی ہیں' (imposing demands), 'کوالٹی کنٹرول کے لیے' (for quality control), and 'تربیت اور نگرانی' (training and monitoring) are clearly preserved. The output makes effective use of alternate phrasing such as 'معمولاً' instead of 'عام طور پر' which both translate to 'generally' in English, helping to maintain the variety in words while keeping the grammar intact. The sentence in the output does not introduce any grammatical errors and manages to convey the same intent as the original.",95
"The paraphrased text manages to partially retain the original meaning but simplifies and slightly alters the context. The original sentence discusses that multiple sites usually require training and monitoring demands for quality control when implementing programs. The paraphrased version simplifies this by stating that the need for multiple sites implies increased demands for training and supervision, which subtly changes the focus and omits the context of quality control and program implementation directly. There are no grammatical errors in the paraphrased text. Though the words and phrases are rephrased, the omission of specific details like 'quality control' and 'implementation of programs' reduces the fidelity to the original text.",70
"The output text is an exact copy of the input text, and the paraphrasing criteria have not been met. There is no use of different words or phrases than the original text, which is an essential requirement for paraphrasing. The only positive aspect of the output is that it does not contain any grammatical errors, and it retains the original meaning and key ideas because it is identical to the input. However, since the task was specifically to paraphrase and that involves changing phrasing while retaining meaning, the output fails to meet this criterion.",10
"The output text accurately retains the original intent and information of the input text, questioning whether any of the friends have older children and if the individual is friends with their own older children or if small children are involved. The paraphrase uses different words such as 'کوئی ایسا ہے' instead of 'کسی کے بھی' and 'آپکی دوستی آپکے بڑے بچوں سے ہے' instead of 'کے ساتھ دوست ہیں' which shows creative rephrasing. However, there is a minor grammatical improvement needed as 'آپکے' should be written as 'آپ کے' for better clarity and consistency. Overall, the paraphrase is of high quality.",92
"The output text encompasses a noteworthy change in wording compared to the original input. It employs synonyms and different phrasing to present the same question about whether friends have older children who engage in activities together and about one's friendship with others' older children or whether all children are young. Both input and output retain the underlying meaning that queries about the age of friends' children and the activities they partake in. However, the reformulation of the phrases introduces some ambiguity by starting with a third-person perspective ('کوئی بھی بڑا بچہ ہے') before referring directly to the recipient's ('آپ') friends' children in the following clauses. Moreover, the output's structured phraseology keeps the context intact despite using altered wording. The output is composed without any grammar mistakes, retaining the grammatical integrity of the original. Therefore, it adequately meets the three criteria set for evaluation.",85
"The output text simplifies the input but changes the meaning considerably. The input text asks if any of the user's friends have older children with whom they do anything, and it asks if the user's older children have friends or if all of them have younger children. The output, however, only refers to whether any of the user's friends have young children and omits the query regarding older children and their interactions or friendships entirely. This significant deviation from the original context alongside the partial textual alteration leads to a considerable score deduction.",40
"The output significantly changes the meaning of the original input. The original text discusses the presence of older children among friends and questions whether these older children have friends or if all have younger children. The paraphrased output, however, merely asks if any of the friends have children, losing specific details about the ages of the children and their friendships.",20
"The paraphrased text retains the original essence which revolves around asking why something was said. The choice of words has changed from 'اس نے' to 'وہ' and 'ایسا کیوں کہا تھا' to 'ایسا کہنے پر کیوں مجبور ہوا تھا', thus sufficient variation in phraseology has been introduced without losing the meaning. The addition of 'مجبور' introduces an element of compulsion, implying a nuance that the person was forced to say it, adding a slight enhancement to the original context without distorting the message. There are no grammatical errors.",95
پیرافریسنگ کے وقت جملے کا بنیادی معنی برقرار رہنا ضروری ہے۔ اصل متن 'اس نے ایسا کیوں کہا تھا؟' کا مطلب ہے کہ 'وہ' شخص نے کچھ کہگیا ہے اور ہمیں معلوم کرنا ہے کہ کس وجہ سے کہا۔ پیرافریس شدہ متن 'کہا کیسے؟ اس کی وجہ کیا تھی؟' شامل ہے جہاں پہلا حصہ 'کہا کیسے؟' کچھ الجھا ہوا ہے کیوںکہ یہ وضاحت کرتا ہے کہ کس طرح کہا گیا تھا، نہ کہ 'کیوں کہا گیا' جو کہ اصل متن چاہتا ہے جاننا۔ اس کی وجہ کیا تھی؟' یہ حصہ بنیادی سؤال کا جواب دیتا ہے، تاہم ابتدائی حصہ معنی کی تبدیلی ہو رہی ہے کیونکہ یہ مرکزی مفہوم کو غلط‌طور پر ڈائرکٹ کر رہا ہے۔ اس لئے کل سکور کافی حدتک کمی ہوگی۔,60
"The paraphrased text in the output introduces a negation ('نہیں') that significantly changes the meaning of the original sentence. The original text 'اس نے ایسا کیوں کہا تھا؟' translates to 'Why did he say that?', while the output text 'اس نے ایسا کیوں نہیں کہا؟' translates to 'Why did he not say that?'. This modification in the meaning indicates that the key idea is not preserved. There are no grammatical errors present, but the main issue is the changed meaning due to the addition of the negation.",10
"The output closely repeats the input without any significant rephrasing, as both the sentences 'اس نے ایسا کیوں کہا تھا؟' and 'اس نے ایسا کیوں کہا؟' literally translate to 'Why did he say that?' in English. The only difference is the slight change in tense from past perfect to simple past, which doesn't notably change the sentence structure or vocabulary. The original meaning is preserved, and there are no grammatical errors, but the requirement for using different words and phrases is not met.",60
"The output successfully retains the original meaning of the input, which describes not needing to mow the lawn often because it did not grow quickly at the speaker's previous house. The paraphrased text uses different phrasing such as 'جہاں آپ کو میرے جنگلات دکھائی دیتے تھے' instead of 'کیونکہ میں جانتا ہوں کہ میرے پچھلے گھر میں آپ کو میرے جنگلات کا پتہ ہے'. Additionally, the paraphrase also rearranges the structure of the sentence while preserving its grammatical integrity and the context of the story being told. The output sentence is free from grammatical errors and successfully uses alternate words and constructs, enhancing the overall quality of the translation.",95
"The meaning conveyed in the output text remains the same as the input: the speaker acknowledges that the listener is aware of the 'jungles' at their former house and notes the lack of necessity to frequently mow the lawn due to slow growth. Grammatically, the output text is correct, and the rephrasing such as 'لان کاٹنے کا ضرورت نہیں تھا' instead of 'اکثر لان کاٹنا نہیں پڑتا تھا' showcases an effective use of alternative wording while retaining the original meaning.",95
"The output does not retain the original meaning of the input. The original text discusses how the speaker did not often have to cut the lawn at their previous house because it didn't grow quickly, but the output incorrectly states that the 'jungle' grows very fast. This not only changes the meaning, it also misrepresents the content of the original message. Besides, the use of 'میرا جنگل بہت تیزی سے بڑھتا ہے' focuses only on the growth rate, while the main idea of the original text was about the infrequency of lawn mowing due to slow growth. There are no grammatical errors in the output, but it fails significantly in retaining the original ideas and using different words appropriately to convey the same meaning.",10
"The output does not retain the original meaning or key ideas from the input. The original text indicates knowledge that forests cannot be mowed often as they do not grow quickly, while the output indicates a straightforward refusal to mow the lawn, changing the context entirely. Additionally, no grammatical errors are present, and the words used are different, but the alteration in meaning negates the successful paraphrasing.",30
"The paraphrased text retains the original meaning very well, stating the importance of hand positions in the images of Buddha, similar to the original text. The output successfully uses alternative phrases such as 'ہر تصویر میں' instead of 'تمام تصویروں کی طرح' and 'ہاتھوں کے انداز کی' instead of 'ہاتھوں کی پوزیشنیں'. There are no grammatical errors in the reformulated text, and it clearly conveys the same idea as the input while using different wording.",95
اس آؤٹ پٹ میں اصلی معنی اور خیالات برقرار ہیں، کیونکہ متن کی معلومات بدھا کی تصویروں میں ہاتھوں کے پوز کی اہمیت پر مرکوز ہیں، جس کا ذکر ان پٹ میں بھی ہوا ہے۔ متن گرامری غلطیوں سے پاک ہے اور الفاظ کا استعمال تبدیل کر دیا گیا ہے، جیسے 'رکھتی ہیں' کو 'انتہائی اہم ہیں' کی جگہ استعمال کیا گیا ہے، جو کہ ایک خوش آئند تبدیلی ہے۔,95
"The output incorrectly changes the original meaning. The input emphasizes that the positions of the hands in all pictures of Buddha are extremely important, whereas the output states that the positions of the hands in Buddha's pictures are not important. This fundamentally alters the conveyed information, thereby failing to retain the original meaning. Additionally, there is no creative paraphrasing as it contradicts the original statement.",0
"The output retains the original meaning of the input which emphasizes the importance of the positions of the hands in the images of Buddha. The output uses slightly different words (تصاویر instead of تمام تصویروں) to convey the same idea but is concise as it omits 'all', mentioned in the input as 'تمام'. This change retains essential information without altering the core message, though it loses a bit of the original detail that emphasizes 'all' pictures. There are no grammatical errors in the paraphrased text, and it effectively uses synonymous terms and a simpler structure while maintaining the meaning.",90
"The paraphrased text retains the original meaning closely, with 'مسائل' transformed to 'موضوعات', reflecting a contextual meaning from 'issues' to 'subjects/topics'. The use of 'سنجیدہ' and 'گہرے' for 'مشکل' changes the nuance from 'difficult' to 'serious' and 'deep', adding quality to the interpretation while keeping the meaning intact. The phrase structure and words are varied enough, enhancing the overall quality of the text without introducing any grammatical errors.",95
"The paraphrased text retains the original meaning which is about Koenli raising important and challenging questions on certain issues. Both the input and output mention 'Koenli', 'important questions', and 'issues'. However, the output uses the word 'چیلنجنگ' for 'challenging', which adds a slight variation to the expression but still maintains the essential meaning. There are no grammatical errors in the output. The words 'مشکل' from the input is transformed to 'چیلنجنگ' in the output, showing an effective use of synonyms. Altogether, the output effectively captures the essence of the original text while implementing a variation in word choice.",95
"The output changes the context by adding 'اپنے کام کے لیے' which was not mentioned in the input. This implies that the questions were raised in the context of his own work, whereas the original text may imply a broader context not limited to his own work. This shifts the meaning slightly from the original. However, grammatically, the output is correct and it does use some different wording such as 'بہت سے' instead of 'مشکل'. The key idea about raising important questions is retained, but the specifics about the context and nature of the questions (difficulty) are lost or changed.",70
"The output text fails to mention 'important' ('اہم') which was part of the original text description of the type of questions raised ('اہم سوالات'). This indicates a partial loss of the original meaning and key ideas in the paraphrase. While the remaining part of the sentence is grammatically correct and the text uses slightly different wording, the omission of a key description affects the overall quality.",70
"The paraphrased text maintains the original meaning that the president's proposal for a new department indicates DHS will handle duties beyond homeland security, including all other transferred tasks and programs. The text utilizes different words and constructions, like replacing 'ذمہ داریوں کے علاوہ' with 'نہ صرف' and 'سرگرمیوں' replacing 'کاموں'. Also, 'ایجنسیوں کے دیگر تمام کاموں' became 'دیگر تمام سرگرمیوں' and 'انجام دینے' was changed to 'سنبھالے گا'. These changes actively demonstrate rephrasing while maintaining the core message. Additionally, the output is free of grammatical errors, demonstrating consistency in quality and accuracy.",95
"The output effectively retains the original meaning, highlighting that DHS will be responsible for all transferred agencies' tasks and programs, in addition to homeland security duties, as indicated by the president's proposal for the new department. There are no grammatical errors found in the output. The paraphrase employs different words and phrases by reordering some parts, like starting with 'صدر کی تجویز کے مطابق' instead of 'نئے محکمے کے لیے', and using 'کردار' for 'responsible'. These changes help in ensuring the original text is paraphrased with a fresh structure and terminology while preserving its core information.",95
اگرچہ اصل متن میں موجود اہم خیالات، یعنی ڈی ایچ ایس کے اضافی ذمہ داریاں سنبھالنے کے بارے میں ذکر ہے، لیکن ترجمہ کردہ متن مختصر ہونے کی وجہ سے کچھ معلومات کھو بیٹھتا ہے۔ مثال کے طور پر، 'نئے محکمے کے لیے صدر کی تجویز' اور 'ہوم لینڈ سیکیورٹی کی ذمہ داریوں کے علاوہ' جیسے جزیات شامل نہیں کیے گئے ہیں جو کہ اصل متن کے مرکزی خیالات ہیں۔ تاہم، جملے کا ڈھانچہ ٹھیک ہے اور گرامر میں کوئی غلطی نہیں ہے۔ کچھ الفاظ مختلف استعمال کیے گئے ہیں، لیکن مکمل معلومات کی فراہمی کے تناظر میں، اس کی کارکردگی بہتر ہو سکتی تھی۔,60
"The paraphrased text generally maintains the original message concerning a proposal regarding additional responsibilities for a department apart from homeland security. However, there's an apparent error with the abbreviation and naming confusion - the original text lists 'ڈی ایچ ایس' (DHS) whereas the paraphrased version incorrectly lists 'DOD', which typically refers to the Department of Defense, not Department of Homeland Security. This mistake alters the specific subject of the sentence, leading to a fundamental change in meaning and creating confusion about the agency being referred to. This could be seen as a factual error rather than a grammatical or paraphrasing issue. Nonetheless, the paraphrase uses varied language appropriately in other parts of the text.",45
پیرافریزڈ ٹیکسٹ نے اصل معنی اور خیالات کو برقرار رکھا ہے کہ 19 ویں اور 20 ویں صدیوں کی بڑی رہائشی جگہیں اب بھی موجود ہیں اور وہ انتہائی بلند عمارات کے درمیان موجود ہیں جہاں جنگلی کشادگی غالب آجاتی ہے. اوریجنل معنی واضح طور پر برقرار رکھے گئے ہیں، جیسے کہ “رہائش گاہوں“ کو “آبادیای مکانات“ اور “فلک بوس عمارتوں“ کو “اونچی اونچی عمارات“ کہا گیا ہے، جو ایک مفید لفظی تبادلہ ہے. تاہم، ,95
"The paraphrased text captures the essence of the original text well by maintaining the reference to the 19th and 20th century's magnificent residences surviving among the skyscrapers. However, the use of 'بچ گئی ہیں' which has been paraphrased to 'حصے بچ گئے ہیں' does not alter the meaning significantly but differentiates the phrasing slightly. The consistency of the subject regarding the jungle attacking the gardens ('جنگل اکثر باغات پر حملہ آور ہوتا ہے') is preserved clearly without any grammatical errors. The use of different words like replacing 'ان عظیم رہائش گاہوں میں سے' with 'کچھ عظیم رہائش گاہوں میں سے' and introducing 'لیکن' for a slight contrast effect are effective yet subtle changes.",90
"The output text has failed to retain much of the original meaning and specific information which the input provided. The original text talks about the great residences from the 19th and 20th centuries being preserved among towering buildings, and gardens often being overgrown by jungles. The paraphrased text simply states that many residences still stand, which is a significant reduction in specificity and detail. Additionally, details about the centuries, the buildings, and the encroaching jungles on gardens have been completely omitted. This drastically changes the context and reduces the richness of information presented originally. Therefore, it also fails in faithfully representing both the complexity and full idea of the original sentence.",20
"The output is missing key information about the time frame ('19 ویں اور 20 ویں صدی') and the frequent invasion of gardens by jungles ('جنگل اکثر باغات پر حملہ آور ہوتا ہے'). This omission is significant as it removes the historical context and the environmental challenge related to the great residences. These details are crucial to retain the original meaning of the input. The output, however, does correctly paraphrase the portion it addresses, using similar terms and maintaining grammatical correctness.",55
"The output retains the original meaning effectively, communicating that EITC represents the fourth largest area for IRS audits for the applicants. Key information such as the position of EITC (fourth largest), subject (applicants), and relation to IRS audits are accurately kept intact. The paraphrased text uses various synonyms and restructures sentences to ensure distinctiveness. Phrase 'ستم ظریفی یہ ہے' is changed to 'دلچسپ بات یہ ہے', and 'درخواست دینے والوں' is converted into 'درخواست دہندگان'. Additionally, 'آڈٹ کے لیے' is paraphrased to 'آڈٹس میں'. There are no grammatical errors in the output.",95
"The paraphrased output maintains the original meaning which states that for the claimants, EITC represents the fourth largest area for IRS audits. Both sentences use slightly different language to communicate the same idea. However, the change in words is limited; only slight variations like 'کا یہ مطلب ہے' instead of 'یہ ہے' and 'کر رہا ہے' instead of 'کرتا ہے' are noted. These changes are minimal and do not significantly alter the sentence structure or the vocabulary used. There are no grammatical errors in the output.",80
"The output merely repeats part of the input text without rephrasing it and completely omits the introductory phrase 'ستم ظریفی یہ ہے کہ درخواست دینے والوں کے لیے،' which is critical for setting the context about who the information pertains to. This omission results in a loss of the original message's meaning and context, leading to a significant decrease in the output's overall quality. Furthermore, there is no use of different words or phrases, indicating a lack of effort in paraphrasing.",20
"The output text is not a paraphrase but rather a partial repetition of the input text. Key contextual setting provided by 'ستم ظریفی یہ ہے کہ درخواست دینے والوں کے لیے' which translates to 'the ironic part for the applicants is that', is completely omitted in the output. This results in a significant loss of the original meaning and context, focusing solely on the statement about EITC representing the fourth largest area for IRS audits. This results in failing to retain the original meaning. Although there are no grammatical errors in the output, the omission of a large part of the original sentence affects the overall quality of paraphrasing.",40
"The output text changes some of the key terminology which alters the original meaning. The original phrase 'ٹرسٹ فنڈز' is paraphrased to 'پراپرٹی کے امانتی فنڈز,' introducing 'پراپرٹی' (property) which isn't mentioned in the original, confusing the context. 'خصوصی فنڈز' changes to 'مخصوص مدات والے فنڈز,' which incorrectly specifies the duration, not present in the original. Further, 'ڈیٹ سیکیورٹیز کی ریٹائرمنٹ' has been changed to 'قرض سکیورٹیز کے انخلا,' where 'ریٹائرمنٹ' (retirement) has been inaccurately changed to 'انخلا' (withdrawal), altering the meaning. Finally, 'ٹرسٹ ریوولنگ فنڈز' is converted to 'امانتی مواقع فنڈز' which inaccurately introduces a new concept of 'مواقع' (opportunities) that isn't in the original. These changes not only change the words but also significantly impact the message and clarity of the original sentence.",20
"The output text maintains the overall meaning of the original input with only a small change regarding the representation of the number '588'. In the input, the context or use of '588' is ambiguous (it may refer to a specific fund or law), while in the output, it is mentioned as 'reference 588' which could potentially imply a specific citation or example, adding a bit of specificity. However, this alteration does not shift the core information conveyed about retirement of debt securities with the exception of trust revolving funds. There are no grammatical errors and the core ideas are intact, even though the wording and construction are extremely similar to the original, showing very minimal paraphrasing.",85
"The output does not retain the original meaning of the input. In the input, there is a mention of 'before' ('سے پہلے') which has been incorrectly changed to 'after' ('کے بعد') in the output, altering the intended temporal context. Additionally, there is an omission of 'except for trust revolving funds (588)', which is a significant piece of information in the original text. The paraphrase introduces a factual inaccuracy and omits crucial information, thus failing to maintain the original content and meaning. The only part that holds true is grammatical correctness.",20
"The output text has omitted a significant portion, specifically 'سوائے ٹرسٹ ریوولنگ فنڈز (588)', from the input text. This deletion changes the context and meaning of the original sentence, which indicates an exception for 'trust revolving funds,' a potentially critical detail. Therefore, while there are no grammatical errors in the output, it fails to retain the original meaning fully due to the omission of a key piece of information.",50
"The output retains the original meaning of the input effectively by confirming the existence of a farm for pets. The output introduces slight variations in the phrasing by adding 'جی ہاں' at the beginning and restructuring the sentence slightly ('یہ ایک پالتو جانوروں کا فارم ہے' instead of directly translating it as 'پالتو جانوروں کا فارم ہاں'). There are no grammatical errors, and the rephrased output is smoothly translated while maintaining the essence and accuracy of the information.",92
"Both the input and output refer to the concept of a 'pet farm', but the output has a slightly altered sentence structure which changes the tone from a confirming statement (input: 'yes, a pet farm') to a descriptive or affirmative statement (output: 'it is a pet farm'). Despite this slight change in tone, the original message meaning remains intact. There is no grammatical error in the translated text. Different words and phrases are not used, but the word order has been changed, which changes the emphasis slightly without losing the original meaning.",90
"The output text successfully retains the concept of a 'farm of pets' from the original. However, the phrase 'پالتو جانوروں کا ڈھیر' translates to 'a pile of pets,' which changes the context slightly from a farm where pets are kept to a pile, suggesting a more disorganized accumulation rather than a managed farm setting. This slight change in the portrayal affects the preservation of the original meaning. Both texts are grammatically correct and there's a good use of different words and structure to convey the idea.",80
"The output 'پالتو جانوروں کا فارم' has omitted the word 'ہاں' from the original text 'پالتو جانوروں کا فارم ہاں'. This changes the meaning significantly as 'ہاں' indicates agreement or confirms the farm is about pets, whereas the output merely states it is a pet farm without that confirmation or assertion. Thus, the output fails in retaining the complete original meaning. No grammatical errors are present, and there is negligible change in words, mostly just an omission.",60
