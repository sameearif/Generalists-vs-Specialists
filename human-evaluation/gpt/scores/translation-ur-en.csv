"The translation provided captures the intended meaning of the original Urdu text clearly and accurately. It conveys the concept of predetermined goodness and the resultant avoidance without adding unnecessary elements or omitting crucial details. There are no grammatical errors in the English translation. Additionally, the tone and style are consistent between both the source and the target texts, maintaining a formal and declarative mood as per the context. Thus, the translation is faithful to the source in terms of meaning, grammar, style, and tone.",100
"The output accurately translates the meaning from Urdu to English. It retains the initial usage of 'ہاں البتہ' as 'Yes, but,' capturing the concessive nuance correctly. The phrase 'جن کیلئے ہماری طرف سے پہلے بھلائی مقدر ہو چکی ہوگی' is aptly translated as 'those who have already been blessed with good fortune from our side,' ensuring that the sense of prior determination and blessing is preserved. 'وہ اس سے دور رہیں گے' translates to 'will keep their distance from this,' maintaining original intent and tone. There are no grammatical errors in the English translation. Overall, the translation effectively captures the essence, tone, and grammatical integrity of the original text.",100
"The translated output significantly omits parts of the original Urdu text and adds phrases that change the meaning. The original text mentions ""جن کیلئے ہماری طرف سے پہلے بھلائی مقدر ہو چکی ہوگی"" which translates to 'for those for whom goodness has already been decreed by Us', but the output translates it to 'given such blessings that they will not be questioned about it' which introduces the additional concept of not being questioned that is not found in the original text. The original also states 'وہ اس سے دور رہیں گے' meaning 'they will stay away from it', which is omitted entirely in the output. This results in a text that significantly deviates from the meaning, content, and style of the original.",20
"The translation from Urdu to English accurately conveys the meaning of the original text without omissions or additions. The English translation maintains the same message that certain individuals are predetermined to receive goodness and will avoid wrongdoing, which is reflective of the Urdu phrase. There are no grammatical errors in the translation. The tone of selectivity and predestination is well retained in the translated text, matching the original style and tone.",100
"The output accurately reflects the meaning of the original Urdu input with clear conveyance of both specifics and nuances, specifically mentioning the desire for a 'child' that is better in 'purity of disposition and affection'. The terms 'پاک طینتی' and 'محبت' have been precisely captured as 'purity of disposition' and 'affection' respectively, maintaining the spiritual and emotional context. There are no grammatical issues within the translated text. However, the translation is in a slightly formal tone that, while appropriate, feels a bit distanced from the warm, evocative nature of the original Urdu tone. Despite this minor stylistic deviation, the translation is excellently executed.",95
"The output translation slightly deviates from the original Urdu text. In the source text, specifics such as 'ان کا پروردگار' are translated as 'God' rather than more specifically 'their sustainer or lord', maintaining a degree of personal engagement. Additionally, the phrase 'پاک طینتی میں اور محبت میں' is translated as 'in the pure and loving world', which is a slight misinterpretation. It would be more accurate to state 'with pure nature and in love' directly reflecting qualities of the child, not the environment. Hence, the output partly conveys the original meaning but misses certain nuances and specific translations that better reflect the meaning of the Urdu language.",70
"The output translation captures the essence and meaning of the original Urdu text accurately. The Urdu text speaks about a desire to replace a child with another who is purer in nature and greater in affection. The English translation adheres to these specifics, noting the elements of 'purity' and 'affection'. The style and tone are maintained appropriately, retaining a formal and respectful approach in both versions. No grammatical errors or awkward constructions can be observed in the translated text.",98
"The translation from Urdu to English manages to generally convey the essential meaning of the original text. However, the translation slightly deviates in style and choice of words which can imply subtle shifts in meaning. The original Urdu text uses 'عطا فرمائے' which implies the act of granting or bestowing, but in the translation, it is rendered as 'change for them', implying a sense of substitution rather than a gift or bestowment. Moreover, 'پاک طینتی' translates directly to 'pure nature', whereas 'purity' in English is somewhat broader and less specific. Additionally, the phrasing in Urdu emphasizes 'ان کی جگہ' suggesting 'in his place' which is slightly nuanced towards replacement, whereas the English implies a simple desire for someone better. The essence of emotional improvement is adequately captured by 'affection'. Overall, the translation is fairly accurate but lacks some nuances of the original text's tone and implications.",75
"The translation successfully conveys the essence and meaning of the original Urdu text to English without any omissions or additions. The original sentence 'تم،، فرٹز جانتے ان دنوں میں سے ایک، میں نے خود اپنی ایک چھڑی کی ضرورت کے لئے جا رہا ہوں.' translates to 'You know, Fritz, one of these days, I'm going to need a cane for myself.' The translated text omits the reference to 'Fritz', which might be the name of the person being addressed, but this does not significantly impact the overall meaning of the dialogue which retains the futuristic need for a cane. Thus, while there is a slight deviation in retaining all elements (omission of 'Fritz'), the general meaning, grammar, and informal conversational tone are well-preserved.",90
"The translation has several issues. First, the translation of 'چھڑی' as 'knife' is incorrect; 'چھڑی' actually means 'stick' or 'cane'. Secondly, the expression 'ان دنوں میں سے ایک,' loosely translated to 'one of those days,' does not fit well in the output context as it doesn't make clear sense of a particular situation, making the English translation sound awkward. Therefore, the meaning is partially misrepresented. Lastly, the conversational tone in the Urdu text indicated by 'تم' (you), addressing someone directly, is lost in the English translation where it turns into a first-person statement without directly addressing anyone. Grammatical structure in English is correct but does not convey the exact meaning of the original text.",50
"The translation from Urdu to English contains nearly all of the intended meaning but lacks slight nuanced expression present in the original text. The Urdu sentence uses 'تم،، فرٹز جانتے ان دنوں میں سے ایک،' which sets a casual and conversational tone, indicating familiarity and a direct address to 'Fritz.' Although the translation captures this tone by starting with 'You know, Fritz,' it omits the punctuation marks that emphasize a pause or a more informal, conversational feel in the Urdu text (shown by commas). Additionally, the Urdu phrase 'میں نے خود اپنی ایک چھڑی کی ضرورت کے لئے جا رہا ہوں.' literally translates to 'I am going myself for a stick I need,' which subtly emphasizes the necessity ('ضرورت') of the action more than the simple 'I had to go.' Thus, the translated text slightly misses out on the nuances of necessity and urgency conveyed in the original. However, it does not contain grammatical errors and maintains an overall casual style and tone similar to the original.",85
"The translation provided is inaccurate and misses several key elements from the original Urdu sentence. The original text includes a person's name, 'فرٹز' which has been translated as 'frets' incorrectly. 'فرٹز' should be translated as 'Fritz,' a proper noun, not as 'frets,' which conveys confusion or worry. Additionally, the Urdu text uses the word 'چھڑی' which means 'stick' or 'cane,' not 'slipper.' Therefore, the meaning of the original text is lost due to these errors. Furthermore, the translation does not maintain the style and tone of the original Urdu sentence. Due to these inaccuracies and mistranslations, the output score is low.",30
"The translation maintains the essence and meaning of the original Urdu text. The input 'اس کا جمع کرنا اور (آپ کی زبان سے) پڑھنا ہمارے ذمہ ہے' translates to 'The collection and the recitation (from your language) is our responsibility.' The translated output effectively captures the elements of collection ('جمع کرنا') and recitation ('پڑھنا'), attributing these responsibilities to 'Our', which corresponds to 'ہمارے ذمہ'. The mention of '(آپ کی زبان سے)' which directly means 'from your language' is omitted in the English version, possibly assuming it as implicit or less relevant in translation. However, this omission might affect the completeness of the translation for someone interested in the specific mention of language. Nonetheless, the translation is grammatically correct and reflects the formal tone of the original text.",85
"The translation accurately captures the meaning of the original Urdu text. It conveys the notion of collecting (or adding up) and reading aloud the content in the target recipient's language, which aligns directly with 'جمع کرنا' and 'پڑھنا' in Urdu. The translation retains the original tone, which implies a formal responsibility. There are no grammatical errors in the English output. However, 'جمع کرنا' might be translated as 'collect' instead of 'add it up' depending on the context, though without additional context, it’s hard to definitively say the choice of 'add it up' is incorrect.",95
"The translation from Urdu to English appropriately captures the basic essence and meaning of the original phrases. The original text, which says 'اس کا جمع کرنا اور (آپ کی زبان سے) پڑھنا ہمارے ذمہ ہے', translates to 'The gathering of it and reading it (from your language) is our responsibility.' The output, 'Surely upon Us (resteth) the collecting of it and the reciting of it,' effectively conveys this meaning but with slightly different words, using 'collecting' and 'reciting' instead of 'gathering' and 'reading'. The parenthetical phrase '(آپ کی زبان سے)' which translates to 'from your language' is indicated in the English output only by the context of 'it,' slightly lacking in specified clarity. The original Urdu phrase's formality and weightiness are maintained in the English output, which uses 'Surety upon Us' to reflect responsibility and importance. No grammatical errors are present in the translated text.",88
"The translation effectively conveys the meaning of the original Urdu text into English without significant alterations. The key aspects, such as the process of collecting and reciting, are correctly translated. The phrase 'اس کا جمع کرنا اور (آپ کی زبان سے) پڑھنا ہمارے ذمہ ہے', specifically refers to ‘collecting’ and ‘reciting', and this nuance is maintained in the translated output. Additionally, the translation uses 'It is for Us to...' which successfully captures the authoritative and inclusive tone (implied by 'ہمارے ذمہ') of the original text. There are no grammatical errors in the English translation, and the style and tone of the original text are retained well.",95
"The translated output accurately maintains the context and meaning of the original Urdu sentence, ensuring that all key components are present. There's successful transition of the conditional 'if' and the speculative 'might be' implying possibility, both crucial for the translated text. However, the phrase 'آج ہو سکتا ہے کہ' could be more smoothly converted to English by finishing the thought or contextually adapting it, as the output feels slightly truncated due to the lack of completion of the original conditional idea. Yet, considering the segment provided and the potential continuation in context, the translation is mostly correct in terms of grammar, style, and tone.",85
"The translated output conveys the overall meaning of the original text but omits a connector that links it to a further implied outcome or condition, which is likely present in a full sentence. The input text ends abruptly suggesting that there is more to be said ('کہ' typically leads to another clause). The English translation should include an indication of this continuation but it does not address this and instead ends as a complete sentence, which changes the implication. The grammatical structure in English is correct. The style and tone are somewhat maintained, though the abrupt end in Urdu is not stylistically mirrored in English due to the lack of indication of an incomplete thought.",70
"The translation has some discrepancies in conveying the exact meaning of the original text. The original Urdu text, 'اگر تم نے سارے صحیح جواب دیے تو تو آج ہو سکتا ہے کہ', translates to 'If you have given all the right answers, then today it might be possible that.' The reference to 'today it might be possible that' is missing a conclusion in both the original and translated text, but it's specifically omitted 'might be possible that', altering the conditional possibility expressed. Additionally, the translation adds 'here', which is not present or implied in the Urdu text. This changes the tone and context. Grammatically, the English translation is correct, but it does not accurately convey the nuances and conditional context of the original sentence.",50
"The output translation does not effectively convey the meaning of the original text. The original Urdu text means 'If you have given all the correct answers, then today it might be possible that,' suggesting a context where correct responses potentially lead to a specific outcome, possibly positive. However, the translated output makes questionable inclusions and alterations, such as 'with the truth' and 'have a great share of the torment on this day,' which does not align with any typical interpretation of the original and distorts the meaning significantly. Moreover, the style and tone are not retained as the translation introduces a context of 'torment,' which is neither present nor implied in the source text.",20
"The translation accurately conveys the original meaning, questioning whether someone possesses supernatural knowledge (علم غیب) that they are documenting. The style and tone, which is inquisitive, is retained in the translation. The grammatical structure in the translated text is correct.",100
"The English translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Urdu sentence. 'کیا ان کے پاس علم غیب ہے جسے یہ لکھ لیتے ہیں؟' has been translated as 'Do they have knowledge of the unseen that they write down?' which captures the essence of questioning whether the group being referred to possesses knowledge of unseen things that they are documenting. The translation is grammatically correct and maintains the rhetorical and inquisitive tone of the source text. No content has been omitted or added unnecessarily, adhering closely to the content and style of the original.",97
"The original Urdu text asks if those being referred to possess supernatural knowledge that allows them to note it down. The English translation effectively conveys this question without adding or omitting any details, retaining the rhetorical and inquisitive tone of the original. There are no grammatical errors in the English translation.",100
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text, which questions whether someone possesses knowledge of the unseen and is documenting it. There are no grammatical errors in the translated text. Moreover, the interrogative style and tone of the original Urdu phrase are well-preserved in the English translation, maintaining the speculative nature of the question.",100
"The translation correctly captures the overall meaning of the Urdu text, which discusses the nature of revelation being received ('وحی جو انہیں کی جاتی ہے' translates to 'revelation that is revealed to them'). The introductory phrase 'وہ تو نہیں مگر' which literally translates to 'It is not that, but' is appropriately conveyed as 'It is nothing but' to maintain the emphatic tone in English. The translation is grammatically correct and maintains both the style and tone of the original Urdu text without any omissions or unnecessary additions.",100
"The translation provides an accurate rendering of the Urdu input into English. The phrase 'وہ تو نہیں مگر' translates correctly to 'He is not, but', and 'وحی جو انہیں کی جاتی ہے' is correctly translated as 'the revelation that comes to them'. The translation maintains the original's meaning without any omissions or additions. However, the structure of the sentence in English might slightly lack the fluidity of native English but it is not grammatically incorrect and conveys the meaning clearly. It also retains the original tone of positioning an entity distinct from the revelation and emphasizing the process of receiving revelation.",95
"The translated output, 'It is only a revelation revealed to him.' slightly shifts the meaning of the original Urdu text. The original text, 'وہ تو نہیں مگر وحی جو انہیں کی جاتی ہے' translates to 'It is not that, but a revelation that is revealed to them.' The use of 'him' in the translation inaccurately limits the revelation to a single person, whereas the original text uses 'انہیں' meaning 'them', indicating a plurality. Additionally, 'وہ تو نہیں' ('It is not that') has not been reflected properly in the translation, losing some crucial contrast and context given in the original text. The style and tone are relatively maintained; however, the meaning alteration and omission significantly affect the quality.",50
"The original text in Urdu 'وہ تو نہیں مگر وحی جو انہیں کی جاتی ہے' translates to 'It is not but a revelation that is revealed to them'. The output 'This is nothing but a revelation revealed,' captures the essence of being a 'revelation revealed,' but misses the specificity of the revelation being done 'to them,' which changes the meaning slightly. Moreover, the phrase 'This is nothing but' in English is a broader interpretation of 'وہ تو نہیں مگر'. The Urdu phrase can be directly translated as 'It is not but'. Additionally, the output omits 'to them' which is crucial for the integrity of the original text. Furthermore, the style and tone are somewhat maintained, but could better capture the nuances of the original phrase.",75
"The output faithfully translates the input from Urdu to English. The core meaning of placing 'high and firm mountains' and providing 'sweet water through springs' is retained. There are no omissions or additions that change the overall message and intent of the original text. The translation maintains the original's descriptive style, though the poetic nature of Urdu might not fully translate into English, the effort to keep the tone is apparent. There are no grammatical errors in the output.",95
"The output accurately translates the input text from Urdu to English. It retains the metaphorical essence and style of the original text, as seen in translating 'بلند و مضبوط پہاڑ' to 'high and strong mountain' and 'میٹھا پانی' to 'sweet water'. The translation also preserves the explanatory context by correctly interpreting 'شیریں چشموں کے ذریعے' as '(through the means of sweet springs)'. There are no grammatical errors in the translated text. Thus, the translation fulfills all the criteria for accuracy, grammatical correctness, and preservation of style and tone.",95
"The output translation has significantly altered the meaning of the original text. The original Urdu text refers to placing strong mountains 'upon it' and providing sweet water, potentially symbolizing sustenance or protection in a general sense. In contrast, the English output shifts the subject to 'him' and mentions 'the Mount' as something that protected and provided for 'him,' which completely changes the context and the apparent subject of the text. Furthermore, the original mention of 'sweet water' being provided through 'sweet springs' is completely omitted, and the overall spiritual or metaphorical tone of the original is lost in translation.",40
"The translation from Urdu to English is generally correct in terms of conveying the main components of the sentence. However, there are some nuances and components missing in the translation: 1. The Urdu phrase 'بلند و مضبوط', which means 'tall and strong', is abbreviated to just 'firm' in English, which misses the emphasis on the height ('بلند') of the mountains. 2. The Urdu phrase '(شیریں چشموں کے ذریعے)', meaning 'through sweet springs', is omitted in the translation, which removes the specific detail of how the water was provided. These omissions affect the depth and descriptiveness of the translation. 3. The structure and grammatical composition of the English translation is correct. However, due to missing components and slightly decreased fidelity in conveying the original tone and imagery connected with 'tall and strong mountains' and 'sweet springs', the score is adjusted accordingly.",70
"The translation from Urdu to English maintains the original message accurately without any omissions or unnecessary additions. It accurately describes that the poster was shared by Tooba on Twitter, including the user handle @Tooba_Sd. Grammatically, the sentence in English is correct. Moreover, since the original sentence was straightforward and informative, the translation successfully retains the style and tone of the original Urdu text.",100
"The output provides an accurate translation from the Urdu input, maintaining the essential information such as the platform (Twitter), who shared the post (Tooba), and Tooba's handle (@Tooba_Sd). The translation is clear and grammatically correct. The tone of the original text, which is straightforward and informative, is also preserved in the translation.",95
"The translation conveys the core meaning of the original text, but it does slightly simplify the expression. The Urdu phrase 'ٹویٹر پر طوبی کی جانب سے شیئر کیا گیا پوسٹر' directly translates to 'The poster was shared by Tooba on Twitter'. In the translation, the inclusion of 'The image' instead of directly saying 'The poster' makes it less specific, though still accurate. Additionally, the Twitter handle '@Tooba_Sd' is omitted in the output, which is a relevant detail about the specificity of the identity and source. There are no grammatical errors, and the translation retains the informative tone of the original message, though it omits a part of the user identity. The translation should fully incorporate all elements of the original text for higher accuracy.",80
"The translated output correctly conveys that Tooba shared a poster on Twitter, matching the content from the original Urdu text. The translation mistakenly omits the Urdu phrase 'طوبی کی جانب سے', which could have been translated specifically as 'by Tooba' to retain closer adherence to the original’s emphasis. However, the translated text carries the core message appropriately and has no grammatical issues. The style and tone, while slightly compressed, essentially retain the informal communication style typical in social media posts. The inclusion of the Twitter handle @Tooba_Sd is accurate, supporting the transmission of all essential information without distortion.",90
"The translation output accurately conveys some aspects of the subject of the original input sentence, but it introduces specific details that are not present in the input. The original sentence 'بن والوں نے بھی پیعمبروں کو جھٹلایا' translates to 'The people of [a specific place or group] also denied the prophets.' The input does not specify 'the people of Noah' which is a significant addition in the translation. Furthermore, the input reads 'پیعمبروں' which seems to be misspelled and likely should be 'پیغمبروں' meaning 'prophets.' Therefore, the error in the input is perpetuated in the output, affecting the grammatical accuracy. The conciseness and straightforwardness of the style and tone, similar to that of the input, are maintained.",70
"The translation contains serious errors. The original text 'بن والوں نے بھی پیعمبروں کو جھٹلایا' should translate to 'the people of Bani also denied the prophets.' The word 'بن والوں' seems to be an incorrect romanization for 'بنی,' which means 'the people of Bani' referring to a specific tribe or clan in historical contexts, often associated with biblical or Islamic narratives. The translated output incorrectly replaces 'بنی' with 'beggars' and 'پیغمبروں' (prophets) with 'the pious ones,' which fundamentally changes the context and meaning from denying prophets to fooling the pious. Moreover, the verb 'جھٹلایا' correctly translates to 'denied' rather than 'fooled.' The output fails to convey the correct entities involved (a specific tribe versus beggars, and prophets versus pious people), the action taken (denying versus fooling), and misinterprets the contextual and cultural significance, leading to significant deviation in meaning.",10
"The translation is partially correct but includes a significant error in the interpretation of the word 'بن والوں'. The correct translation for 'بن والوں' should be 'the people of Ban' referring potentially to a specific group or clan, likely historical or tribal, not 'the people of the forest'. Therefore, this introduces a confusion about the identity of the people discussed. While it accurately translates the rest of the sentence regarding the rejection of messengers, the incorrect identification of the group leads to a misunderstanding of the whole scenario or narrative context.",40
"The translated text remains true to the central meaning of the original sentence, accurately conveying that a group rejected the messengers. The original sentence refers to 'بن والوں' which has been translated as 'the dwellers of the Wood.' While the translation may seem contextually specific, it lacks clarity without additional context about 'بن والوں' being specifically meant as 'the dwellers of the Wood.' The translation also repeats 'the dwellers of the Wood' unnecessarily, affecting the stylistic flow and clarity. Nonetheless, the translation correctly conveys the denial of the messengers which is crucial. Thus, the score will reflect a slight stylistic deviation but maintain a high rating for accurate conveyance of the main action.",90
"The translated text successfully conveys the intended meaning of the original Urdu text without any significant additions or omissions. It effectively captures specific phrases and idioms from the source (such as 'We hear and we disobey,' and other related corrections they could use), and translates them into English while maintaining clarity and the contextual sense. The tone and style of the original religious critique are preserved, focusing on the disdain for the distortion of words and highlighting the consequences of such actions, which align with the critical and admonitory tone of the original text. Overall, the translation adheres to the grammatical standards expected in English, ensuring that the message is delivered without confusion to the reader.",95
"The translation captures the essence of the original text but includes slight misinterpretations and imprecisions. The original utilizes specific Arabic verses such as 'سَمِعنَا وَ عَصَینَا' - a phrase originally meaning 'We hear and we disobey' which is improperly translated to 'listen to us and obey us'. This phrase is meant to represent defiance rather than submission which is crucial to the original sentiment. Additionally, the phrases 'اِسمَع غَیر مُسمَع' and 'رَاعِنَا', which are translated as 'hear, but do not hear', and 'watch, but do not watch', are not reflecting the original nuances effectively. The original phrases are used in a derogatory and deceptive context which is partially lost in translation. Despite these issues, there are no grammatical errors and the translated text does retain the general direction and tone of the original, pointing out a critical look at certain behaviors while mentioning the divine consequences of such acts. However, due to precision issues in the translation of key phrases, the overall score is lower.",70
"The output translation significantly deviates from the original text's meaning and context. Major theological and interpretative elements from the Urdu text are missing in the English translation, such as the specific phrases 'سَمِعنَا وَ عَصَینَا' ('We hear and we disobey'), 'اِسمَع غَیر مُسمَع' ('Listen, may you not be made to listen'), and 'رَاعِنَا' ('Look at us'). These phrases are crucial as they reflect the original accusation of distortion and manipulation by certain followers. Furthermore, the provided translation introduces phrases like 'Hush!' and 'Do as you are doing, verily, Allah will see your doings...' which are not present in the original text, showing unwarranted additions. The original messages about the better alternatives 'سَمِعنَا وَ اَطَعنَا' ('We hear and we obey') and consequences due to false worship are omitted, leading to incomplete conveyance. Overall, the translation changes the foundational elements and religious nuances, which misrepresents the essence of the original scripture.",20
"The output translation does not include the exact phrases mentioned in the input text or their correct meanings, showing significant content alteration and omission. Phrases like 'سَمِعنَا وَ عَصَینَا' and 'اِسمَع غَیر مُسمَع' are crucial to the meaning of the original text but are substituted with unrelated terms such as ‘Safa’ and ‘Ayn,’ and ‘Amjad,’ and ‘Ra’ina.’ which are neither equivalents nor contextually related. Additionally, the sentence structure and the detailed explanation of how they could correct their actions and the consequence of their action in religious context are missing, thus leading to loss of original style and tone. Other phrases are inaccurely translated or completely omitted. Overall, the output greatly differs from the input, failing to convey the intended meaning and tone correctly.",15
"The translation from Urdu to English is fairly accurate and maintains the essence and tone of the original text. The original text is phratic in nature, and this tone has been well preserved in the translated version. ‘سخت کھاری’ was translated as 'bitter', which captures the intended meaning, though a direct phrase translation could perhaps be 'extremely salty' to match the literal wording. However, 'bitter' still conveys the intended impact effectively in English. The phrase 'پھر کیوں تم شکر گزار نہیں ہوتے؟' is well translated as 'so why are you not grateful?' which retains both the interrogatory form and the emphasis on lack of gratitude. The choice of pronoun ‘We’ in the translated text suggests a respectful and authoritative subject, which aligns with the original text that implies a higher power but might not be clear for those unfamiliar with the context. Overall, the translation is effectively rendered but could slightly enhance the clarity on the subject.",90
"The translation captures the overall meaning of the original Urdu text quite accurately. The original text is a rhetorical question, expressing a hypothetical condition (making something very bitter) and questioning the lack of gratitude in response. The translated text successfully maintains this structure and intent. However, the choice of the word 'bitter' for 'کھاری' is slightly incorrect as 'کھاری' technically refers to 'salty' or 'brackish', which might alter the perceived harshness or the exact nature of the taste referred to. The tone and rhetorical style of questioning are appropriately preserved from Urdu to English. Despite this minor inaccuracy in word choice, the translation effectively retains both the grammatical correctness and the expressive style of the original.",85
"The translation captures the overall meaning and intent of the original Urdu text, effectively translating its rhetorical question and structure. The interpretation of 'سخت کھاری' as 'bitter' fits well in the translated context. The text maintains the admonitory tone, aiming to remind the reader of their lack of gratitude. However, the use of 'We' in capital might suggest a religious or respectful nuance in English, aligning with the original text's connotation to respect God or a higher power. There's no observable grammatical error, and the translated text remains concise and faithful to the Urdu source in both style and meaning.",95
"The translation effectively captures most of the meaning from the original Urdu text, although with minor deviations. The Urdu sentence 'ہم چاہیں تو اسے سخت کھاری بنا کر رکھ دیں' suggests making 'it' extremely bitter, and this nuance is retained with 'We could make it bitter' in English. The phrase 'پھر کیوں تم شکر گزار نہیں ہوتے؟' translating to 'Will you not then be grateful?' captures the propositional content and the reproachful tone directed at someone's lack of gratefulness. Thereby, the translation adequately retains the original's meaning and tone. However, 'سخت کھاری' (extremely bitter) losing its intensity slightly to 'bitter' in English slightly underrepresents the strength of the Urdu term. This very slight dilution leads to a minor deduction.",95
"The translated output accurately captures the meaning of the original Urdu text without any omissions or additions. The phrase 'لکڑی کا صندوق' is correctly translated as 'A wooden box', and 'پرانا تابوت' as 'an old coffin'. The sentence structure and tone are preserved, reflecting a simple declarative form. There are also no grammatical errors in the translation.",100
"The output accurately translates the input text from Urdu to English. The phrase 'لکڑی کا صندوق' is translated as 'Wooden box', and 'میرے خیال سے یہ ایک پرانا تابوت ہے' is correctly translated to 'in my opinion, this is an old coffin'. There are no omissions or additions, and the translation preserves the original meaning and tone without any grammatical errors.",100
"The translation accurately captures the meaning of the original text, translating 'لکڑی کا صندوق' as 'Wooden box' and 'پرانا تابوت' as 'old coffin'. The sentence structure in the output correctly corresponds to the input. The informal and observational tone of the source is also well maintained in the output, making it a faithful translation regarding style and tone. There are no grammatical errors in the output.",100
"The translation incorrectly interprets 'تابوت' as 'bucket' instead of its correct translation 'coffin'. This misinterpretation significantly alters the meaning of the original sentence, as a coffin and a bucket serve very different purposes. The rest of the translation correctly captures the components of the sentence, but this key error lowers the overall quality and accuracy of the translation.",40
"The output accurately translates the original Urdu text, preserving both its meaning and tone. The translation successfully communicates that the people who denied the signs of Allah have been turned away. The phrase 'اسی طرح' is aptly translated as 'Thus', and the rest of the sentence similarly aligns well with the source text. There are no grammatical errors and the style is consistent with the original expression, using a formal structure suitable for religious or solemn texts.",98
"The translation captures the overall meaning of the original Urdu text, but the sentence structure in English changes the emphasis slightly. The Urdu sentence directly correlates the continuous action of turning away specifically with those who denied the verses of Allah. However, the English output introduces a slight ambiguity by placing 'They too continued to turn away' at the beginning, making 'who denied the verses of Allah' seem like a subordinate clause that modifies the first part. Additionally, the translation style and tone do maintain a literal simplicity, though it slightly alters the focus. There are no significant grammatical errors.",85
"The translated text captures the essential meaning of the original Urdu text without any omissions or additions. It conveys the idea of people being turned away because of their denial of Allah's signs. The English translation uses 'Thus,' which aligns well with 'اسی طرح' in Urdu, maintaining the style and tone effectively. Both the input and output texts are free from grammatical errors. The translation thus adheres closely to all specified criteria.",95
"The translated output accurately captures the essence and meaning of the original Urdu text. 'اسی طرح وه لوگ بھی پھیرے جاتے رہے' translates to 'Thus are turned away' which correctly reflects the continuation of action mentioned in Urdu. 'جو اللہ کی آیتوں کا انکار کرتے تھے' is translated as 'those who deny the signs of Allah,' retaining the subject and their action from the input. The output maintains the style and tone of religious scriptural narration that is present in the original text, and there are no grammatical errors in the translation.",100
"The translated output accurately captures the meaning and tone of the original Urdu text. The original text expresses a clear disapproval and disbelief towards the behavior of those being addressed, specifically in terms of their worship practices. The translation retains this expression ('I am disgusted with you and those whom you worship besides Allah') effectively conveying the strong emotional stance of the speaker. The translation also incorporates the rhetorical question at the end ('Then do you not reason?') which is a direct translation of 'پھر کیا تمھیں عقل نہیں ہے' and serves to question the reasoning behind their actions, preserving the critical tone. There are no grammatical errors in the translation. Overall, the translation is faithful to both the content and the style of the original sentence.",100
"The translation from Urdu to English is accurate and captures the overall meaning of the original text. The original Urdu sentence, 'میں تم سے اور جنہیں الله کے سوا پوجتے ہو بیزار ہوں پھر کیا تمھیں عقل نہیں ہے', translates to an expression of disdain for those who worship entities other than Allah, followed by a rhetorical question about lacking sense or understanding. The translated text maintains this meaning without any significant omissions or additions. Grammatically, the English sentence is correct and conveys the same level of formality and confrontational tone as the original. Therefore, it meets all the specified criteria well.",95
"The translated output effectively captures the key meaning of the original text. The original Urdu text conveys a statement of disapproval or rejection directed at the objects or entities other than Allah that are being worshipped. The translated output in English succinctly and exactly captures this by stating, 'I am disgusted with what you worship besides God.' Additionally, the challenging rhetorical question at the end 'پھر کیا تمھیں عقل نہیں ہے' is appropriately translated to 'if you have any sense,' which maintains the tone and conveys the emphasis on reason and understanding, questioning the sense of the addressed individuals. There are no grammatical errors in the translation and the sharp, critical tone of the original is retained. However, there's a slight deviation with the inclusion of quotation marks in English which were not present in the Urdu text, potentially indicating direct speech or a quotation where this interpretation is not clearly required by the source text. Thus, small adjustments could be made.",95
"The translation accurately renders the original Urdu text into English. The key phrases such as 'بیزار ہوں' are correctly translated as 'I am quit of you', which is a strong expression of disavowal or distancing oneself, fitting the original tone and contextual meaning. The translation then accurately continues with the reference to worshiping others besides Allah, maintaining the original's religious connotations without omitting any details. The question 'پھر کیا تمھیں عقل نہیں ہے' is effectively presented as 'Do you not understand?', capturing the rhetorical force in a straightforward manner. Moreover, there are no grammatical errors in the output and it retains the seriousness and confrontational tone of the original statement.",100
"The translation from Urdu to English successfully conveys the original meaning without any omissions or additions. The imagery of 'سہمی ہوئی نگاہوں' is aptly translated as 'with fearful eyes', and 'گویا وه بکھری ہوئی ٹڈیاں ہیں' is accurately translated as 'as though they are scattered locusts', maintaining the metaphorical style of the original text. There are no grammatical errors in the translation. The output retains both the tone and style of the original text, which reflects a vivid and somber imagery.",100
"The translation significantly alters the original metaphor used in the Urdu text. The original text compares people emerging from their graves with 'scattered locusts' (بکھری ہوئی ٹڈیاں), which suggests a sense of chaos and disorder. However, the translation changes this imagery to 'worn-out threads,' which conveys a sense of frailty and weariness instead of chaos. Additionally, the phrase 'سہمی ہوئی نگاہوں' (frightened eyes) is inaccurately translated as 'tired and exhausted eyes,' losing the original sense of fear or alarm. Therefore, both the metaphor and original connotations are not accurately captured in the translation.",20
"The output effectively conveys the meaning of the original text. The metaphorical comparison of people coming out of their graves to 'scattered locorns='locusts' is retained. Additionally, the phrase 'downcast eyes' correctly translates 'سہمی ہوئی نگاہوں,' capturing the tone of fear or solemnity. However, the translation omits 'کے ساتھ' which connects 'with downcast eyes' directly as a simultaneous action in English. The overall style, tone, and metaphors of the original text are well preserved in the translation despite this slight omission of linking phrase.",90
"The translation captures the meaning of the original Urdu text quite effectively. The phrase 'سہمی ہوئی نگاہوں کے ساتھ' is translated as 'in fear,' which accurately expresses the scared and cautious disposition depicted in the original text. The comparison of people coming out of their graves to 'bikhri hui tiddiyan' (scattered locusts) is aptly conveyed with 'as if they were locusts spreading around.' The translation contains no grammatical errors and the style and tone are also retained, with an appropriate use of simile, matching the original. Therefore, the translation is high quality.",95
"The translation from Urdu to English is generally accurate in terms of meaning. However, the Urdu phrase 'قدم رکھا جا رہا ہے کے ہمارے دن Titans کے زیادہ تاکنا' literally translates to 'Our day is being marked/steps are being taken for more observation of the Titans.' The English translation has missed the nuance of 'steps are being taken', which indicates an active initiation or process. Instead, it just mentions the day being marked by closer observation. Although the central idea is somewhat retained, the sense of commencement or initiation from the Urdu text is omitted in the English output. Moreover, the translation is grammatically correct and maintains a neutral descriptive tone, similar to the original. However, there is a slight deviation in style due to missing elements of action suggested in Urdu.",75
"The translation has significantly distorted the meaning of the original text. The original Urdu phrase 'قدم رکھا جا رہا ہے کے ہمارے دن Titans کے زیادہ تاکنا' seems to involve the notion of embarking or stepping into an era dominated by or involving 'Titans' with a connotation of increased vigilance or observation. However, the translated text 'Our days are being spent in setting up Titans as if we are going to take a lot of them.' completely misinterprets the elements of 'setting up' and the notion of 'taking a lot of Titans,' which doesn't align with the original meaning. Furthermore, it incorrectly suggests a physical action ('setting up') and an objective ('take a lot of them') that are not present in the source, demonstrating errors in conveying the original tone and meaning.",20
"The translated output partially captures the essence of the original Urdu text but fails in several grammatical and contextual details. The Urdu phrase 'قدم رکھا جا رہا ہے کے ہمارے دن Titans کے زیادہ تاکنا' translates to something along the lines of 'It is happening that our days are increasingly dominated by the Titans.' The output 'Our Titans are taking more of our days' simplifies the context too much and omits the ongoing nuance suggested by 'قدم رکھا جا رہا ہے' (is being stepped), thus losing the intended emphasis on the ongoing process. Furthermore, it completely drops ‘تاکنا’, which adds a sense of 'watching' or 'overseeing' that implies dominance or control. Although the overall theme of dominance or influence of 'Titans' is somewhat retained, crucial nuances and the exact expression are lost, affecting the quality of the translation.",50
"The translation from Urdu to English has several issues that hinder comprehensibility and accurate conveyance of the original message. The grammatical structure of the English sentence is confusing, and the phrase 'Promise Titans more on our day' does not logically connect with 'that step is being taken.' It seems like there is a mixing of metaphoric or idiomatic expressions which aren't translated properly. Additionally, the Urdu text is slightly ambiguous but the translation does not clarify this ambiguity nor maintains the original's style or tone.",35
"The translation effectively conveys the original meaning of the Urdu text, which talks about not looking at the earth to see how it is spread out. There are no grammatical errors in the translated sentence, and it retains the instructive and contemplative tone of the original. Therefore, the translation accurately reflects the content, style, and tone of the source material.",100
"The output captures the general meaning of the input text but introduces a slight deviation in meaning. The original text emphasizes the act of 'spreading out' or 'laying out' the earth which conveys a broader or more general sense, potentially referring to creation or the natural state of the earth. The translation 'cultivated' implies human intervention in farming or agriculture, which narrows the interpretation and deviates from the original meaning. There are no grammatical errors and the style and tone are maintained respectfully, but the specific word choice changes the nuance of the original text.",80
"The translation successfully captures the general meaning of the original Urdu text, which comments on observing how the earth is laid out. However, the translation lacks smoothness. The English rendition could be better phrased for more clarity and adherence to natural language use, e.g., 'And [look] at the earth, how it has been spread out?' Additionally, the punctuation in the output shifts from the contemplative nature of the original statement to a slightly questioning tone with the use of '?'. This subtly alters the tone although it remains mostly respectful and inquisitive. Minor improvements in phrasing and punctuation could enhance the translation’s fidelity to the original’s tone and style.",80
"The output captures the essence of the original Urdu text but misses certain elements which slightly alters the tone and style. The original sentence 'اور زمین کی طرف نہیں دیکھتے کہ کیسے بچھائی گئی ہے۔' directly translates to 'And do you not see how the Earth has been spread out?' The output, however, omits the phrase 'do you not see,' cutting straight to 'And at the earth,' which changes the rhetorical nature of the sentence. Additionally, the output loses the confrontational and pondering tone of the original text, by phrasing it more like a straightforward question, rather than maintaining a reflective query.",80
"The translated output accurately conveys the meanings of the original Urdu text, which attributes qualities to 'He', presumptively referring to a divine entity, as forgiving and loving. Both critical adjectives 'بخشنے والا' (forgiving) and 'محبت کرنے والا' (loving) are correctly translated, retaining the original attributes without any addition or omission. The translation is grammatically correct in English, with appropriate use of definite articles 'the' for emphasis on the qualities. Furthermore, the tone is maintained, reflecting a respectful and declarative style, suitable for the context of discussing divine attributes. The simple, clear style of the original text is preserved in the translation.",100
"The translated text accurately reflects the meaning of the original Urdu text without any omissions or additions. The original sentence 'اور وہی ہے بخشنے والا محبت کرنے والا' translates to 'And He is the one who forgives and loves', which is precisely conveyed in the output. Both grammatical accuracy and the preservation of the original tone and style, which is affirmative and declarative, are maintained in the translation. Therefore, the translation effectively meets all the specified criteria.",100
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Urdu text without any omissions or additions. The Arabic terms for attributes, such as 'بخشنے والا' and 'محبت کرنے والا,' are translated as 'Forgiving' and 'Affectionate' respectively, which are appropriate and correct in English. The style and tone of the original religious or reverential expression are maintained in the translation. There are no grammatical errors in the translation.",100
"The translation accurately captures the essence and meaning of the original Urdu text. The adjectives 'Forgiving' and 'Loving' successfully convey the qualities attributed in the Urdu expression 'بخشنے والا' and 'محبت کرنے والا' respectively. The translation maintains the style and reverence of the original, using a comma to separate the attributes as is typical in formal English lists, which complements the Urdu phrasing well. There are no grammatical errors in the English output.",100
"The translation accurately conveys the original meaning without any omissions or additions, covering the concept of asigning portions of livestock and crops to Allah and idols, and the resulting misallocation as per the belief and judgement of the people mentioned. The translated text retains the critical tone and commentary on the actions described, reflecting the critical perspective of the original text on the misjudgment by these people. The translation is also free from any grammatical errors.",98
"The translation effectively conveys the original meaning without any significant omissions or additions. It accurately represents the division of shares among Allah and their partners (gods) as discussed in the original text, along with the consequential misallocation represented by the shares meant for Allah reaching their partners instead. The stylistic and tonal aspect of commentary on the situation ('What kind of wrong decision are they making?') is also well preserved, keeping the critical tone intact. However, there is a slight shift in phrasing from 'اسی کی پیدا کی ہوئی کھیتی اور مویشیوں' to 'cattle and crops they have cultivated', which slightly shifts focus from divine creation to human efforts in cultivation. Nonetheless, this does not significantly affect the overall integrity and meaning of the translation.",95
"The translated text successfully conveys the general message of the original Urdu text. It retains the idea of assigning portions and the respective share distribution between Allah and idols as depicted in the original. However, the output slightly differs in the expression of emotional judgment and stylistic tone. The phrase 'یۙ لوگ کیا ہی برا فیصلہ کرتے ہیں۔' is rendered as 'Evil is the way they judge!', which, while it captures the condemnation inherent in the original, the paraphrasing shifts the style from a direct comment on the decision-making ('کیا ہی برا فیصلہ') to a more abstract statement about their judgement methodology. Additionally, 'مویشیوں' directly translates to 'livestock' rather than the more generic 'cattle', so there's a slight specificity loss there. Furthermore, the output omits 'پیدا کی ہوئی' which connotes 'they have produced', leaving out the implication of human involvement in production in Allah’s designated share.",85
"The translated output conveys the primary meaning of the input text, accurately reflecting the concept of assigning parts for Allah and others as per the belief system described. The translation retains the notion of unfair or misguided distribution between Allah and other partners, capturing the criticism of this human practice. However, the phrase 'کھیتی اور مویشیوں' (crops and livestock) is generalized to 'tilth and cattle', which is broadly accurate but slightly changes from specifying various agriculture and animals to a more generalized form. Additionally, the Urdu text's style, which emphasizes disdain for the errant practice (indicated by the phrase 'یہ لوگ کیا ہی برا فیصلہ کرتے ہیں'), is maintained in the translation through the phrase 'Evil is the judgement that they make.' There are no grammatical errors in the translation, and the tone of disapproval is appropriately conveyed.",85
"The translation from Urdu to English is accurate and captures the essence and direct accusatory tone of the original text. It successfully conveys the meaning without any omission or unnecessary addition. The translated text is grammatically correct and maintains the original style and tone by using 'Indeed' and 'truly' which correspond to the emphasis created by 'بے شک' and 'بلکہ' in Urdu. Therefore, it meets all the required criteria effectively.",100
"The output does not translate the original Urdu text but instead responds by refusing to translate and offering further assistance. This response does not meet the criteria as it neither conveys the meaning of the original text nor retains the style and tone. The original text involves a critical or harsh expression, but the output sidesteps this by addressing the content's nature and refusing translation. Therefore, it cannot score well on accurately conveying the original message, grammar correctness in translation is not applicable, and it does not retain the original style or tone.",0
"The translated text captures the essence and criticism expressed in the original Urdu text but splits it into two sentences for clarity in English. The Urdu text critically states that the addressed group engages in sexual behavior with men instead of women and describes them as excessively transgressive. Both criticisms are preserved in the translation, although the tone in English may come off slightly harsher with terms like 'Surely' and 'indecent.' The Urdu term 'شہوت رانی' which can directly translate to 'lewdness' or 'lustfulness' is replaced with 'indecency,' which carries the right connotation. Moreover, the term 'حد سے بڑھنے والے' is translated as 'insolent people,' matching the phrase's intensity but shifting the meaning slightly from 'exceeding limits' to 'insolence.' This changes the flavor of the misbehavior described slightly by adding an element of rudeness or disrespect which is implied rather distinctly compared to the original. However, there are no omissions or additional irrelevant details, and the translation follows good grammatical structure.",85
"The translated text captures the main essence and message of the original Urdu text, which condemns approaching men with lust instead of women and labels such behavior as transgression. However, the translation introduces minor stylistic differences, such as using 'instead of' which is a direct but slightly less emphatic match compared to the original. Also, the original text uses 'بے شک' which translates more directly and emphatically to 'indeed', which is well translated. Overall, the message, tone, and core content are preserved, making it a fairly accurate translation, though it could have retained exact structural parity for perfection.",91
"The output translation has misunderstood the context and structure of the input sentence. The input sentence 'میں تم جانتے ہو سب کچھ بتا دے گا.' implies that the speaker is addressing someone, likely saying that he 'the speaker' will tell everything that 'the addressee' knows. However, the tonality and structure of the sentence in Urdu also imply an expression of assertiveness or a challenge, which is not correctly conveyed in the English translation. The translation turns the meaning around incorrectly indicating that it is the listener who knows everything which the speaker will tell, which changes the original intent of the sentence. Additionally, the translation has grammatical issues with the tense and subject agreement, making it sound unnatural.",30
"The translation incorrectly interprets the Urdu sentence. The original sentence 'میں تم جانتے ہو سب کچھ بتا دے گا' roughly translates to 'I know you will tell everything.' In the provided translation, the grammatical subject 'I' and object 'you' are reversed, which changes the context of the sentence completely. Additionally, there is no retention of tone as the confidence indicated in the original sentence by assuming knowledge about the other's action ('will tell') is lost in the translation. There are also grammatical issues tied to the Urdu structure that are not reflected accurately.",40
"The input 'میں تم جانتے ہو سب کچھ بتا دے گا' translates directly as 'I will tell you everything I know.' The output accurately preserves the meaning without adding or omitting any content. There is a grammatical mistake in the original Urdu text where 'جانتے' is incorrectly used; it should be 'جانتا' for a singular male subject. However, the English translation correctly ignores this grammatical lapse and provides a fluent, grammatically correct output. The style and tone of the original, which seems conversational and direct, are nicely retained in the English version.",95
"The original Urdu text 'میں تم جانتے ہو سب کچھ بتا دے گا.' is intended to mean 'I will tell you everything that you know.' However, there is a grammatical error in the Urdu sentence; the verb conjugation 'جانتے' is incorrect for the subject 'میں'. It should be 'جانتا' to match 'میں'. Despite this error, translating this with the intended meaning would be more accurate than the output provided. The output 'I'll tell you everything you know.' could be interpreted differently, potentially meaning that the speaker is confirming what the listener already knows rather than informing them of what they know, which partially shifts the emphasis. Moreover, the translation needs to emphasize that the speaker is the one who will be disclosing the information, which is clearly intended in the Urdu text.",65
"The output translation inaccurately interprets 'Parre' which does not make sense in the context and seems to be a transcription or typographical error of a proper Urdu word. The input possibly intended to express a context where the wife and son should be looked after or mentioned, but 'Parre' doesn't align with any meaningful Urdu expression. Moreover, 'for viewing' is an awkward translation of 'دیکھنے کے' which simply means 'to see' or 'to look at' in a more general context, rather than 'for viewing' which suggests an exhibition context. The tone and style are also not smoothly retained as the translation changes the implied action in the original statement.",25
"The original Urdu input 'Parre میری بیوی اور بیٹے کو دیکھنے کے' contains an unusual or possibly mistyped word 'Parre', which does not make sense in this context. Hence, the core message with possible interpretation is 'to see my wife and son'. The output translated it to English as 'To see my wife and children.' The translation misinterpreted 'بیٹے' (son) as 'children', changing the specific to the more general, and inaccurately increasing the number of individuals referred to. The error in the noun 'children' impacts the accuracy and fidelity of the translation.",70
"The output correctly translates the key elements of the input sentence. The Urdu phrase 'میری بیوی اور بیٹے کو دیکھنے کے' translates to 'look at my wife and son' in English, which is accurately captured in the output. However, the Urdu word 'Parre' has been omitted, which might be an imperfection in capturing the input accurately as it could imply a specific mood or additional context like urgency or emphasis. Despite this, the main content and intent of the original sentence are maintained, and there are no grammatical errors in the resulting English translation.",90
"The original Urdu text 'Parre میری بیوی اور بیٹے کو دیکڠنے کے.' translates to 'Look at my wife and son.' in English. The translated output 'Pardon my wife and son.' is incorrect because it uses 'Pardon' instead of correctly identifying the intended action of looking or seeing. Hence, the translation fails to convey the accurate verb and overall meaning of the original Urdu sentence. Additionally, the style and tone are also not retained, as the error shifts the context significantly.",20
"The translation accurately captures the meanings conveyed in the source text. There are no additions or omissions. The sentence retains the solemn and reflective tone of the original. Grammatically, the English translation is also correct. Therefore, the translation meets all the criteria perfectly.",100
"The translated output 'He who created me is also guiding me.' effectively conveys the meaning of the original Urdu text 'وہ جس نے مجھے پیدا کیا سو وہی مجھے ہدایت فرماتا ہے،'. It retains the essence of creation and guidance without any omission or addition of concepts. The translation preserves the subject matter and the implication that the creator is also the guide. However, it simplifies the structure slightly, using a common English phrase structure which slightly alters the tone but not the meaning. There is no grammatical error in the translation.",95
"The translation from Urdu to English accurately captures the essence of the original statement. The elements of 'Who created me' and 'He guides me' correspond well to 'وہ جس نے مجھے پیدا کیا' and 'وہی مجھے ہدایت فرماتا ہے' in Urdu, respectively. The translation maintains the simplicity and reverence of the original phrase, effectively retaining the style and tone. There are no grammatical errors in the translated text. However, the translation could slightly be improved by translating 'سو' as 'thus' to more explicitly connect the two clauses as in the original, but the absence of this does not significantly detract from the overall meaning.",95
"The original sentence in Urdu 'وہ جس نے مجھے پیدا کیا سو وہی مجھے ہدایت فرماتا ہے،' translates to 'He who created me also guides me.' The translated English output 'He who created me, and He guides me.' conveys the key components of the creator also being the guide, but the flow and style of the sentence are slightly altered. The connector 'سو' which implies 'therefore' or 'thus' is missing, leading to a change in the expression and a slight disconnect in the continuity of the thoughts between creation and guidance. Therefore, while the key meaning is present, the cohesion and exact reflection of the original text's style and structure are somewhat lacking.",85
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text without any omissions or needless additions, maintaining the context and message. It properly translates cultural and religious nuances, reflected in phrases like 'اللہ نے کسی کو بیٹا بنالیا ہے' to 'Allah has adopted a son' and 'پاک و پاکیزہ' to 'absolutely pure and clean'. The style and tone of reverence and clarification from the original text, specifically in lines such as 'وہ اس امر سے پاک و پاکیزہ ہے' and 'بلکہ وہ سب اس کے محترم بندے ہیں', are well preserved in the translation. Additionally, there are no grammatical errors in the English translation.",100
"The translation conveys the main ideas of the original Urdu text but slightly misrepresents some details. The phrase 'اللہ نے کسی کو بیٹا بنالیا ہے' is better translated as 'Allah has taken a son' rather than 'created someone as His son,' which introduces a subtle shift in meaning. Additionally, 'بلکہ وہ سب اس کے محترم بندے ہیں' should be translated as 'rather they are all His esteemed servants' instead of 'they all consider Him as their revered Lord,' altering the subjects’ perception and respect towards Allah slightly. No grammatical issues are present, and the style and tone are fairly consistent with the original, maintaining a serious and respectful tone.",85
"The translation has successfully conveyed the general meaning of the original text, stating that people claimed God has begotten a son and attributing purity to God by stating, 'Glory be to Him!' The nuance of God's servants being highly regarded is also accurately reflected in the translation with 'His servants are the ones who are close to Him.' However, the phrase 'پاک و پاکیزہ' is translated only as 'Glory be to Him!', which only partially captures the emphasis on purity present in the original. Additionally, the structure and mood have been slightly altered; the original employs a more formal and solemn tone typical to theological discussions in Urdu, which has been slightly softened in the English translation. Overall, while the core message remains intact, the translation misses some of the reverence and formal tone expressed in the original.",85
"The translated output captures the essence and meaning of the original Urdu text well but changes the tone slightly. The original text uses a more formal and narrative style, which is somewhat maintained in the translation but with less fluency and a more direct statement 'And they say'. The translation omits slight details like 'یہ کہنا شروع کردیا' which implies 'started to say', giving a sense of continuation which the English output misses. Additionally, 'حالانکہ وہ اس امر سے پاک و پاکیزہ ہے' translates to 'while He is pure from this matter', indicating sanctity in a particular context, which is broader in the original but reduced simply to 'Hallowed be He!' Moreover, 'بلکہ وہ سب اس کے محترم بندے ہیں' translates to 'Nay, they are all His honored servants' which is somewhat retained in 'Aye! they are slaves honoured' but misses the exact reverence of 'honored servants' with the use of 'slaves', which carries a slightly different connotation. Overall, the translation is mostly accurate but not flawless in tone and style.",85
"The translation communicates the essence of the question asked in the original Urdu text but with minor issues in phrasing that might cause a misunderstanding. The original text literally asks if someone 'can wear two from a single necklace?', implying wearing two strings or items derived from one necklace. The English translation adds 'at the same time' and translates 'ہار' as 'necklace' which is accurate, but the phrasing 'two at the same time' makes it slightly confusing as the Urdu original directly relates to the feasibility of utilizing parts of a single necklace in two different ways simultaneously. There are no grammatical issues in the output. The style and tone of a query or hypothetical question are correctly retained.",85
"The translation has correctly interpreted the question asked in Urdu. However, there is a minor mistake in translating the word 'ہار' which means 'necklace' in Urdu, whereas it has been translated to 'earrings'. This changes the object being discussed but the structure and the query format has been maintained properly.",80
"The original Urdu text translates to 'Can you wear two of the same necklace?' whereas the translated output talks about wearing 'two different heels'. This output incorrectly translated the item being referred to ('ہار' meaning necklace, not heels) and also incorrectly translated the descriptor from 'one' to 'different'. The meaning, context, and specific details of the original sentence are not accurately conveyed.",20
"The original text asks if 'one can wear two of the same necklaces' with an error in the Urdu phrase ('ہار' should be used instead of 'ہی'). However, the translation incorrectly interprets 'ہی ہار' as 'losing pairs', which does not make sense in this context. Additionally, the questioning format is maintained but the entire meaning is misconstrued making it a translation error.",10
"The translation from Urdu to English retains the essence of the original message. The meaning of the first sentence about the flight to Krakow being postponed until the next announcement is well conveyed and accurately translated. The second sentence queries if the time has been noted, which corresponds well to the original Urdu question about having taken the time. There are no grammatical errors, and the tone of urgency and inquiry is maintained throughout, reflecting the urgency of the flight delay and the need for noting the time accurately. However, the word 'کراکوژیہ' is slightly inaccurately translated to 'Krakow'. Although 'Krakow' is a close approximation and makes sense in this context, 'کراکوژیہ' typically refers to 'Krakozhia,' a fictional country from the movie 'The Terminal.' Nonetheless, given the context and common understanding, this slight deviation doesn't heavily impact the overall quality of the translation.",90
"The output translation captures the basic information of the input text but has minor issues in fluency and contextual appropriateness. The phrase 'کراکوژیہ جانے والی پرواز' is translated adequately as 'Flight 866', but the specific destination (Krakozhia) is omitted, which is critical for the meaning. The sentence 'اگلے اعلان تک موخر کر دی گئی ہے' is translated as 'has been postponed till further announcement,' maintaining the meaning correctly. However, the question 'کیا تم نے وقت لیا ہے؟' is translated as 'Have you taken time?' which, while structurally correct, does not convey the nuances and typical use of the phrase in Urdu, potentially asking if the other person has checked the time or made time for something. The translation does not fully retain the style and nuance of the original query.",85
"The translated output communicates the essence of the original text, indicating that Flight 866 has been delayed. However, there's a slight discrepancy in the translation of 'کیا تم نے وقت لیا ہے؟' which actually means 'Have you taken the time?' or 'Did you note the time?', not 'Have you checked in?'. The translation of 'موخر کر دی گئی ہے' as 'has been delayed' is accurate. However, the erroneous translation of 'Have you checked in?' changes the nuance of the query being asked in the original text, reducing the overall fidelity. Although grammatically the output is correct, the minor issue in conveying the exact inquiry affects the quality by not retaining the original tone where checking or noting time is being asked, rather than inquiring about the check-in process.",80
"The translated output conveys the core message of the original text accurately. The mention of 'flight 866 to Krakozhia' and its postponement align correctly with the Urdu input. However, the query 'Have you taken a time?' is less clear in English. In Urdu, 'کیا تم نے وقت لیا ہے؟' might mean asking if someone noted the time or scheduled the time, but 'taken a time' in English is vague and doesn't specify the context sufficiently, hence it could lead to confusion. Also, 'until the next announcement' is a direct translation but matches the meaning from the input. Therefore, while the key information is translated correctly, the phrasing of the question at the end may reduce clarity.",85
"The translated output accurately captures the essence and meaning of the original Urdu text. The word 'حوروں' which refers to 'maidens' or 'houri' in the context of Islamic texts has been rightly translated into English. The translation retains both the style, using formal language ('Indeed'), and the tone of the original text. There are no grammatical errors in the English translation, and it conveys the intended meaning well without any omissions or unwarranted additions.",100
"The output translation incorrectly translates the word 'حوروں' as 'robots'. The correct translation for 'حوروں' should be 'houris,' which are mythical, beautiful, heavenly beings described in Islamic belief, not 'robots.' Therefore, the output fails to convey the meaning of the original text correctly. This represents a significant error in understanding and translating the cultural and religious contexts of the word.",20
"The translation adds extra information that is not present in the original Urdu text, such as 'in the (Gardows of Delight)'. The core meaning of the sentence 'Indeed We have created the fair maidens' is preserved, matching the original intention which declares the creation of maidens by a divine entity, presumably highlighted by 'بیشک' and 'ہم نے'. However, the appended details in the English translation could mislead about the context or specifics that the original Urdu text does not specify. Furthermore, there are no grammatical errors in the output and style and tone are generally maintained with a reflective and conclusive expression.",80
"The translation from Urdu to English contains an interpolation not present in the original text. The original text 'بیشک ان حوروں کو ہم نے ایجاد کیا ہے' simply states 'Indeed, we have created those maidens.' The word 'حوروں' in the original text refers specifically to 'maidens' typically understood in a religious context as beautiful, pure beings. The phrase '(for a female purpose)' in the translation adds an interpretation that is not implied in the original Urdu text. Additionally, the word 'female' is too general and doesn't capture the nuance of 'حوروں'. Hence, the translation inaccurately extends the original message, affecting the fidelity of meaning, and introduces an addition that changes the tone and potentially the perceived intent of the text.",65
"The translated output accurately conveys the meaning of the original Urdu text, reflecting both the literal and implied nuances effectively. The phrase 'وہ کہیں گے: ایک دن یا ایک دن کا بھی کچھ عرصہ۔ سو تو گننے والوں سے پوچھ لے۔' is accurately captured as 'They will say: 'It lasted a day, or part of a day.' Ask those who keep count.' The translation maintains the simplicity and directness of the original text. There are no grammatical errors, and the style and tone are preserved, staying true to the intent and context. Hence, it scores high on conveying the original meaning, grammatical correctness, and retaining the original style and tone.",98
"The translation from Urdu to English conveys the meaning of the original text well and is overall grammatically correct. However, the translated output adds a few words ('the days') which are not present in the original text ('سو تو گننے والوں سے پوچھ لے'), and this introduces a specificity in the English version that somewhat diverges from the general notion suggested in Urdu. The original does not specify 'the days' but generally refers to 'ask those who are counting.' Nevertheless, the tone and style are fairly consistent, maintaining a slightly instructive and declarative tone. These factors lead to a slight deduction due to addition but overall still a high-quality translation.",85
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Urdu text, with all significant details included. The phrase 'ایک دن یا ایک دن کا بھی کچھ عرصہ' is well translated as 'A day or part of a day', capturing the implication of uncertainty about the exact duration. The suggestion to verify by asking is translated appropriately with 'now ask of those who keep account' which aligns well with 'سو تو گننے والوں سے پوچھ لے'. The output retains the style and authoritative tone of the original text, making it a direct and concise statement. There are no grammatical issues in the English translation. Overall, the translation retains the original message, style, and tone without any errors.",100
"The translation accurately captures the meaning of the original Urdu text without any omissions or additions. The phrase 'وہ کہیں گے' is correctly translated as 'They will say'. The next part, 'ایک دن یا ایک دن کا بھی کچھ عرصہ', is appropriately conveyed as 'We stayed a day or part of a day'. Furthermore, 'سو تو گننے والوں سے پوچھ لے' accurately translates to 'Ask those who keep count'. The grammatical structure in the output matches that required by English syntax, ensuring a smooth and logical progression of ideas. The style and tone of the original are also retained, maintaining the directive and slightly mysterious quality of the statement.",100
"The translated output accurately captures the meaning of the original Urdu text. The key components of the sentence such as 'بیشک' (Indeed), 'جھٹلانا' (denial), 'کافروں' (disbelievers) and 'حسرت' (regret) have been correctly interpreted and represented in the English version. There are no omissions or additions in the translation, and it retains the emphatic tone as conveyed by 'بیشک'. Moreover, the translation uses appropriate grammar, maintaining the structure and coherence of the original sentence.",100
"The translation correctly captures the core message of the original Urdu text. The term 'حسرت' is aptly translated as 'regret'. The phrasing 'for infidels' appropriately translates 'کافروں پر'. Also, the insertion of '(to blaspheme)' provides context for 'یہ جھٹلانا', making clear what specifically is a cause of regret, despite slightly adjusting the original phrase structure, which might implicitly hold the meaning of disbelieving or denial rather than specifically 'blaspheme'. However, the translation maintains the general intent and tone of the original, focusing on the sentiment of regret experienced by infidels, which refers to disbelief or denial of truth in the broad sense. Hence, most of the subtleties and meaning from the original text are retained, and there are no grammatical errors.",95
"The translation captures the overall sentiment of the original text effectively. The phrase 'بیشک' translates to 'indeed' or 'certainly,' which emphasizes the certainty of the statement, but its intensity is somewhat lost in the translation. The output uses 'will be' indicating a future tense that aligns well with the original implication. The term 'کافروں' is accurately translated to 'unbelievers.' 'حسرت' has been rendered as 'deep regret,' which is a precise translation conveying the depth of emotion. The style and tone are respectfully maintained, though minor details like the emphatic nature of 'بیشک' could have been better highlighted.",90
"The output successfully captures the meaning of the original Urdu text. The term 'بیشک' is accurately translated to 'Indeed' which conveys certainty, aligning with the source text. The phrase '(یہ جھٹلانا)' though presented within brackets in the English translation, is implied and correctly conveys the context of denial or rejection, maintaining the essence of 'یہ جھٹلانا' (this denial). 'کافروں پر' is translated as 'for the faithless', correctly referring to those who do not believe, which matches the original term 'کافروں' (disbelievers or faithless). The word 'حسرت' is translated as 'regret', effectively conveying the emotional weight intended in the original. There are no grammatical errors, and the style and tone of declarative and slightly solemn nature are retained.",100
"The translation accurately captures the meaning of the original Urdu text, translating subjects like divine accountability and consequences for actions in both belief and disbelief effectively. It maintains the theological and solemn tone of the original text, demonstrating no omissions or additions that detract from the original meanings. The Urdu passive constructs and reverence towards the divine subjects are well translated into English while retaining their gravity. Also, there are no grammatical errors in the translation making it fluent and readable, adhering closely to the standards of formal written English.",98
"The translated text retains much of the meaning of the original Urdu text, conveying the central themes of divine promise, creation and re-creation, faith and consequences of disbelief. However, the opening phrase of the English translation, 'It's your turn, all of you,' does not quite capture the implied return or fate contained in 'اسی کی طرف تم سب کو پلٹ کر جانا ہے' which directly means 'You all have to return towards Him.' This is a subtle but important deviation in terms of religious context. Additionally, the translation slightly simplifies the explanation of rewards and punishments, missing some nuances such as 'complete justice' in dealing with good deeds, and the intensity of 'suffer a painful punishment' could be more precisely matched to the original text's 'دردناک سزا'. Overall, the translation is proficient but could better capture the nuanced meanings and rhetorical constructs of the original.",80
"The translation accurately conveys the overall meaning of the original Urdu text. The concept of returning to a deity, the assurance of Allah's promise, the description of creation, and the fate of believers and disbelievers are all maintained in the translation. The translation also retains the serious and solemn tone of the message. However, the translation is a bit less detailed in a few areas: it simplifies 'کھولتا ہوا پانی پییں' to 'a boiling sea' rather than specifically mentioning drinking boiling water, and 'دردناک سزا بڍگتیں' is not clearly reflected as 'undergoing painful punishment'. Nonetheless, these aspects do not deviate significantly from the central messages, hence only slightly affect the quality.",90
"The translated text captures the essence and meaning of the original Urdu text well. It accurately conveys the concept of returning to God, the initiation and continuation of creation by God, and the differentiated outcomes based on belief and actions (rewards for the believers and punishment for the disbelievers). The style and tone of the translation remain consistent with the Urdu text, retaining a formal and declarative nature. However, the smallest part at the end of the Urdu text describing the reasons for the disbelievers' punishment ('اُس انکار حق کی پاداش میں جو وہ کرتے رہے') is simplified in the translation to 'because they disbelieved.' Though this is not entirely incorrect, it reduces some of the detail about the continuous nature of disbelief depicted in the original text. Despite this, the translation maintains grammatical correctness without any errors.",95
"The translated text accurately captures the meaning and tone of the input. The questions in Urdu 'کس کو؟' is correctly translated to 'To whom?' in English, maintaining the interrogative form. The affirmation 'جی ہاں!' is accurately translated to 'Yes!', preserving the tone and direct response style. There are no grammatical errors or deviations in meaning, tone, or style from the original text.",100
The translation accurately captures the meaning of the original Urdu text without any omissions or additions. The phrase 'کس کو؟' directly translates to 'Who is it?' in English and 'جی ہاں!' translates to 'Yes!' in English. The output retains the interrogative style and the affirmative tone of the input. There are no grammatical errors in the translated text.,100
"The translation from Urdu to English faithfully conveys the meanings of the words '-کس کو؟' as '- Who?' and 'جی ہاں!' as 'Yeah!'. The minimal and direct nature of both the input and the output means there is no significant tone or stylistic depth to manage, making this a straightforward translation scenario. All grammatical aspects are correctly handled in the translation.",100
"The translation from Urdu to English lacks the complete equivalence of the original expression. The input has '-کس کو؟ جی ہاں!' which translates to '-Who? Yes!' The output provided only includes '- Who?' and omits the 'Yes!' part, which is a significant part of the response in the original text. This omission changes the meaning and function of the phrase. Additionally, in Urdu, the hyphen is accurately portrayed to capture the truncation or urgency, but it is prioritized differently in English translation as such punctuation usually isn't followed immediately by a space in English grammar.",50
The translation accurately conveys the original message without omitting or adding any details. It retains the informational style and tone of the original Urdu sentence. There are no grammatical errors in the translated text.,100
"The translation captures the essence of the original text, illustrating that a large number of people from Lahore are queued up outside hospitals to donate blood. However, the phrase 'خون کا عطیہ دینے کے لئے' in the original text simply means 'to donate blood' and does not imply that the donation is 'for free,’ which is an addition in the translated text. This could potentially change the perception of the original statement, as adding 'for free' emphasizes the voluntary nature without direct indication from the source text. Additionally the translation 'men and women from Lahore' slightly deviates in style from 'Lahore men and women' in the original, making it a tad less direct.",85
"The translated text does convey the general meaning of the original text but has missed a couple of subtleties. Firstly, the translation missed 'کیونکہ', which is critical to contextualizing the sentence as giving a reason for some preceding statement or situation. Secondly, the phrase 'لاہوری مرد اور خواتین' should ideally be 'Lahore men and women' instead of 'Lahore men and women', reflecting the adjective 'لاہوری' which specifically points to the people being from Lahore. Furthermore, the phrase 'اس وقت' translates to 'at that time', which has been appropriately included, but the continuous aspect of the action described by 'کھڑے ہیں' which translates to 'are standing' was simplified to 'stand', omitting the ongoing nature of the action in the Urdu sentence. This overall changes the urgency and immediacy conveyed in the original text.",80
"The output correctly conveys the meaning of the input in a comprehensible manner. However, the translation could be slightly more accurate in using the term 'blood donations' instead of 'give blood-donations' for a more natural English rendition. Additionally, 'Lahore men and women' can be streamlined to 'men and women from Lahore' for better clarity and readability. Both 'کیونکہ' ('because') and 'اس وقت' ('at this time') are accurately translated, maintaining the original text's causal and contextual presentation.",85
"The translation from Urdu to English is accurate and keeps the original meaning intact. The phrase 'تصویر از مشارت الله جان' translates correctly to 'Image by Masharat Allah Jan,' appropriately attributing the image to the person named Masharat Allah Jan. There are no grammatical errors in the output, and it maintains the straightforward, factual style and tone of the original text.",100
"The translation output has made an error by literally interpreting 'مشارت الله' as 'Allah's mercy,' which is not contextually appropriate. The correct translation should focus on the specific meaning of the word, which typically refers to someone named rather than translating it as 'mercy.' Hence, the output fails to convey the original meaning and context.",20
"The provided output translates the Urdu input 'تصویر از مشارت الله جان.' correctly into English as 'Photo by Msharet Allah.' However, the English output improperly transliterates the name. The Urdu name 'مشارت الله جان' should be transliterated more accurately as 'Musharat Ullah Jan' where 'جان' means 'Jan' typically used as an honorific or term of endearment in names in Urdu context. The translation and transliteration should accurately reflect original names, especially proper nouns, to maintain authenticity and accuracy. Therefore, although the translator correctly interprets the structure and the meaning of 'Photo by', the name's transliteration needs adjustment.",70
"The output 'Image by permission.' does not retain the original meaning of the Urdu phrase 'تصویر از مشارت الله جان.' The original text seems to attribute the image to someone possibly named 'Masharat Allah Jan,' but this is not clear from the input alone without context. The translation incorrectly interprets it as 'by permission,' suggesting a misunderstanding of the term 'مشارت' which can mean 'recommendation' or 'consultation' in other contexts but seems to be a proper noun in this case. Therefore, there is a significant error in conveying the meaning and retaining the original tone.",20
"The translation accurately conveys the original message, directing those with faith to verify news brought by an unreliable source before taking any action that might wrongly affect others, thus maintaining both the meaning and advisory tone of the original text. The translation includes all the essential elements of the Urdu text without any omissions or unnecessary additions, and is grammatically correct in English. It successfully retains the instructive and cautionary tone, aligning well with the religious and ethical undertones of the original.",98
"The translated output closely matches the input in terms of meaning. The original message urging the believers to verify a news report brought forth by an unreliable person (transgressor) before acting upon it, to prevent undue harm or regret is effectively conveyed in the translation. Grammatically, the English text is correct and maintains a respectful and admonitory tone similar to the original Urdu. There are no additions or omissions that alter the fundamental meaning of the text, ensuring an accurate translation.",95
"The translated text accurately conveys the meaning of the original Urdu text. The message in the original, advising believers to verify information brought by unreliable sources to avoid causing harm out of ignorance, is effectively captured in the English translation. The translation uses a respectful and advisory tone, which aligns well with the tone of the original text. Additionally, the translation maintains the style, translating the religious and formal tone appropriately. There are no additions or omissions that alter the meaning and no grammatical errors in the translation.",100
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text, which instructs believers to verify news brought by unreliable sources to prevent causing harm unknowingly and then regretting their actions. There are no grammatical issues in the translation. Moreover, the style and tone of the original text, which is advisory and cautionary, are also well maintained in the translation.",100
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text without any omissions or additions. The grammatical structure in the output is correct and aligns well with the input. Moreover, the tone and style are retained as both the input and the output express a straightforward statement about responsibility for a mistake. Overall, the translation is precise and faithful to the source, maintaining both the meaning and the presentation.",100
"The translation accurately captures the meaning of the original Urdu sentence without any omissions or additions. The phrase 'تو یہ آپ کی غلطی ہے' translates directly to 'This is your mistake', maintaining both the grammatical integrity and the directness of the original tone. There are no grammatical errors, and the style and tone have been retained effectively.",100
"The translation from Urdu to English accurately captures the meaning of the original text without any omissions or additions. The original Urdu phrase 'تو یہ آپ کی غلطی ہے' directly translates to 'So this is your fault.' The output given as 'So that was your fault.' uses 'that was' instead of 'this is', which slightly changes the immediacy of the reference (from present to past tense). However, the core meaning remains intact. There are no grammatical errors in the translated text, and the tone retains a direct and accusatory manner similar to the original text.",90
"The translated output 'So it's your fault' accurately captures the meaning of the original Urdu text 'تو یہ آپ کی غلطی ہے'. There are no omissions or additions, and the translation maintains the causal tone implied by 'تو' at the start of the sentence, which is effectively conveyed with 'So'. There are no grammatical errors in the output. Overall, the translation successfully retains the meaning, style, and tone of the original text.",100
"The translation retains the essence and tone of the original Urdu text effectively. The phrase 'میں تجھ سے رحمٰن کی پناه مانگتی ہوں' is accurately translated as 'I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you'. Additionally, the clause 'اگر تو کچھ بھی اللہ سے ڈرنے واﻻ ہے' is well translated into 'if you do fear Allah.' There are no grammatical errors in the English translation. Overall, the translation maintains the integrity and the style of the original Urdu text without omissions or additions.",98
"The output translation inaccurately conveys the meaning of the original text in several key aspects. The term 'رحمٰن کی پناه' is translated as 'Rahim's forgiveness' instead of 'the protection of Rahman'. 'رحمٰن' and 'رحیم' represent different attributes of Allah, and their specific meanings are quite distinct. Furthermore, the phrase 'میں تجھ سے رحمٰن کی پناه مانگتی ہوں' should be 'I seek refuge in Rahman from you' rather than 'I beg for Rahim's forgiveness from you'. Additionally, 'اگر تو کچھ بھی اللہ سے ڈرنے واﻻ ہے' is meant to imply a condition concerning the person's fear of Allah, correctly translated as 'if you are God-fearing at all'. The translated output modifies the original meaning and misinterprets the terms, significantly impacting the accuracy and specificity of the translation in religious context. This error not only shifts the tone but also alters the spiritual and interpersonal nuance of the text.",30
"The translation conveys the core meaning of the original Urdu text, which is about seeking refuge and mentioning the fear of Allah. However, the explicit mention of 'رحمٰن' which is a specific attribute of Allah as 'the Beneficent' enhances the translation by adding depth, but may not represent the common translation of the term 'رحمٰن' simply as 'Allah' in everyday speech. Also, the Urdu phrase 'کچھ بھی' typically translates to 'at all', emphasizing the condition more than 'if you do', which might slightly alter the intended emphasis of condition in the original text. Despite these nuances, the essential message, tone, and grammatical correctness are maintained.",85
"The translated text captures the meaning of the original Urdu input effectively. The Urdu text is a supplication for protection and invokes the name of Allah (referred to as Rahman, meaning The Most Beneficent), which is correctly conveyed in the English translation. The output retains the tone of supplication and cautiousness present in the original. The grammatical structure of the English translation is correct, and there are no errors or deviations from the source text. Thus, the translation is accurate both in terms of meaning and linguistic aspects.",95
"The translation accurately captures and conveys the meaning of the original Urdu sentence without any omissions or incorrect additions. The phrase 'مسٹر تم کچھ جانتے ہیں' is effectively translated to 'Mr., you know something', and 'اور مجھے اس کا یقین ہے' to 'and I am sure of it.' The translated text retains the simplicity and directness of the original text, maintaining both grammar and coherence effectively. The use of 'Mr.,' instead of 'Mr' may seem slightly informal, but it does not significantly distract from the overall quality or accuracy of the translation.",95
"The translation successfully conveys the meaning of the original Urdu text. The subject 'مسٹر' translates to a formal address like 'Mr.', which is missing in the English output, slightly affecting the style and tone intended by the original. However, the main content is translated accurately without grammatical errors. The omission of a direct address ('مسٹر') is a minor deviation but affects the personalized tone.",90
"The translation generally maintains the meaning of the original text but misses a subtle nuance. The Urdu phrase 'مسٹر تم کچھ جانتے ہیں' should ideally be translated as 'Mister, you know something,' which is slightly different from 'Mister, do you know something' as the latter introduces a questioning tone that is not present in the original. Additionally, the phrase 'اور مجھے اس کا یقین ہے' is translated as 'and I believe you.' However, a more accurate translation might be 'and I am sure of it,' to better convey the certainty expressed in the original. There are no grammatical errors and the style is maintained. Despite some nuances lost in the conversion of assertive tone to an interrogative one, the translation still mostly delivers the basic message.",85
"The translated text accurately captures the meaning of the original Urdu sentence while maintaining grammatical correctness. The original text addresses someone respectfully as 'مسٹر' ('Mr.' in English) and conveys a confident assertion about the knowledge of the person being addressed, which is mirrored in the English translation. The tone is retained, using a formal address ('Mr.') and maintaining the structure of belief and knowledge attribution. However, the direct translation might have slightly more personalized touch in Urdu, whereas English sounds a bit more direct. But overall, the message, tone, and structure are well preserved without any errors or omissions.",98
"The translation effectively conveys the meaning of the original Urdu text, maintaining the message about creation and the transcendent nature of the creator. The translation also retains the formal tone of the original text and avoids grammatical errors. However, the term 'برتر' was translated as 'exalted', which, although correct, slightly modifies the intensity and style in comparison to the direct translation 'superior' or 'above'. This choice does subtly alter the stylistic nuance, but not significantly to lower the rating drastically.",92
"The translated text captures the essence and meaning of the original Urdu sentence effectively. The phrases 'آسمان اور زمین' and 'heavens and earth' are accurately translated. The term 'بجا بنائے' is aptly rendered as 'created... in truth,' since 'بجا' implies rightly or justly formed, which correlates well with the translation. However, 'شرک' typically refers to the concept of polytheism or associating partners with God in Islamic terminology, which is only loosely captured by 'their association'. The term should perhaps be better contextualized to reflect its theological significance, such as 'idolatry' or 'polytheism' to fully convey the original nuance. The style and tone are maintained with a formal and solemn expression appropriate to the context of the original text.",85
"The translation does not accurately convey the original meaning. The phrase 'بجا بنائے' which translates to 'rightly made' or 'properly created' has been distorted to 'in true (proportions)'. The term 'وہ ان کے شرک سے برتر ہے،' also has not been translated effectively, meaning 'He is above their association/shirk (polytheism)'. The output has added 'He has imposed on the two most beautiful pairs:' which is not present in the original text, thus introducing an addition and altering the meaning significantly.",30
"The translated text accurately conveys the meaning of the original Urdu text without any omissions or additions. The original sentence emphasizes the creation of the heavens and the earth and the superiority of the creator over any associates. The translation maintains this message effectively. Both the grammatical structure and the style are appropriately handled, mirroring the original's tone of reverence and authority. Therefore, the translation meets all the criteria effectively.",100
"The translated text closely captures the message from the original Urdu text and retains all the major elements like questioning the signs given to the Messenger compared to Moses, accusing both holy scriptures as magic, and declaring rejection of all. The tone and style of the message, which is reflecting a confrontational and argumentative discourse, is retained in the English text. No grammatical errors were present in the English output. The translation is direct and preserves both the explicit and implied meanings without any addition or significant omission.",96
"The output effectively conveys the contextual meaning of the input text with a few minor omissions, generally maintaining the original style and tone. The English translation keeps the interrogative stance and the essence of skepticism and denial portrayed by the speakers regarding the signs given to prophets. However, the output glosses over the specifics of 'ہمارے حضور' ('in our presence'), which could imply an element of immediacy or personal witness that is not fully captured. Also, while the Urdu text uses emphases such as '(تو)' implying immediacy of reaction, which is not distinctly conveyed in English. Nevertheless, these are minor nuances and do not significantly distort the overall meaning. The translation might be slightly smoother with these minor adjustments, but it is largely accurate and maintains the integrity of the original message.",90
"The translation effectively conveys the meaning of the original text without omitting or altering the intended message. The major elements such as questioning the signs given to the prophet compared to Moses, acknowledgment of disbelief in the signs given to Moses, and the claim that both the Quran and Torah are akin to magic and support each other, are all accurately translated. Furthermore, the style and tone of the original text, which is a critical narrative of disbelief and questioning, have been maintained in the translation. There are no grammatical errors in the translation, making it a well-structured flow from Urdu to English.",95
"The translation from Urdu to English generally maintains the meaning of the original text, capturing the questioning and doubt expressed about the signs and revelations given to prophets. However, it omits the last part of the input regarding their final rejection ('اور انہوں نے کہا کہ ہم (ان) سب کے منکر ہیں،' which translates to 'and they said, ""we disbelieve in all [of them]"",'). The omission of this part slightly alters the emphasis and entirety of the narrative. Other than this, the text is translated without grammatical errors and retains the interrogative and somewhat sceptical tone of the original. The crucial conversation about disbelief in both the Quran and Torah as alleged magic is well captured.",85
"The translation accurately captures the essence and details of the original Urdu text. All elements, including the reference to 'those who were given knowledge and faith', their response, and the statement about the 'Day of Resession' as outlined in the 'Book of Allah', are correctly translated into English. The translation is fluent, retaining the original tone and style, maintaining a formal and somber tone which is appropriate for the religious context of the text. There is no alteration in the message, no grammatical errors, and the original phrasing like 'You abided indeed as the Book of Allah decreed' is translated to directly correspond to the original text's meaning and style.",100
"The translation captures the message of the original text but misinterprets the speaker and the audience in the passage. The original Urdu text specifies that the people endowed with knowledge and faith are addressing another group, reminding them of their destiny as described in the Book of Allah and noting the current day as the Day of Judgment, which the other group failed to believe. The English translation inaccurately suggests that the knowledgeable and faithful group is speaking about themselves when they argue that 'They will remain firm until the Day of Judgment, just as you were given the Book of Allah.' This changes the nuance of the direct address and accountability in the text. Furthermore, a more precise phrasing could have been maintained for better clarity and fidelity to the source text.",80
"The output significantly rephrases and simplifies the original message. Key details about the accusation of denial ('لیکن تم تو یقین ہی نہیں مانتے تھے') are lost in the translation. The phrase 'you did not know' doesn't properly convey the idea of not believing or denying in Urdu ('یقین ہی نہیں مانتے تھے'). Also, the style and directness of the original text are somewhat softened in the translated version. The translation needs to maintain the essence and accusatory tone of the original text more accurately to preserve both the message and the emotional impact.",60
"The output correctly translates the overall meaning of the input text but alters some of the original stylistic choices and nuances. For instance, in the Urdu text, the phrase 'تم تو یقین ہی نہیں مانتے تھے' is traditionally rendered as 'but you did not believe,' whereas the output says 'but you were not convinced.' This reflects a slight shift in tone. Additionally, the phrase 'جیسا کہ کتاب اللہ میں ہے' is translated as 'as God has written in the Book,' which while correct, could more closely mirror the original by using 'as is in the Book of Allah' to keep the specific reference clear. Overall, the translation provides an accurate representation of the meaning while slightly differing in tone and specificity.",85
"The translated text effectively conveys the original message, capturing the interactive dynamics between the two situations: publicly professing belief and privately questioning intra-community discussions. The translation remains faithful to the dialogue’s essence, questioning the disclosure of certain knowledge that could be used argumentatively. Grammatically, the translation is sound, with no errors in English syntax or semantics. The tone, which includes a shift from a declarative to an interrogative mood, is preserved, reflecting both the affirmation of belief and the questioning of wisdom in sharing sensitive information. Thus, the translation meets all the criteria excellently.",98
"The translation conveys the overall meaning of the original text but introduces some ambiguities and inaccuracies that alter parts of the message. The phrase '
جب مسلمانوں سے ملیں تو کہیں' is overly simplified in translation to 'And when we meet with Muslims, we bring faith with us.' which loses nuance. The original text doesn't exactly say 'we bring faith with us' but more accurately 'we say we have brought faith.' Moreover, the last part of the text, 'کہ اس سے تمہارے رب کے یہاں تمہیں پر حجت لائیں کیا تمہیں عقل نہیں', is poorly captured in translation. The translated phrase 'and we remind you of your Lord's favor' does not accurately reflect 'اس سے تمہارے رب کے یہاں تمہیں پر حجت لائیں'. The essential meaning involving arguing or reasoning before your Lord about this is omitted. Additionally, the rhetorical question at the end does convey the intended meaning of questioning wisdom, although it slightly deviates in tone.",70
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Urdu text. It captures both the contexts of interacting with believers and discussing privately among non-believers. The phrasing like 'they say: We believe' and 'Do you talk to them of what Allah has disclosed to you' are directly reflected in the Urdu text. Additionally, the translation maintains the admonitory tone and rhetorical questioning style with 'Do you not then understand?', mirroring the original's intent and expression closely. Therefore, it meets the criteria of preserving the original's meaning, style, and grammatical integrity.",100
"The translation accurately captures the original text's meaning, converting from Urdu to English while maintaining the context of the differing statements made by the speakers in different situations. It also retains the original text's tone, which includes a questioning and somewhat accusatory style, particularly evident in the phrase 'Have you no sense?'. The translation is grammatically correct without any omissions or additions, effectively conveying the same message and emotion as the Urdu text.",100
"The translated output accurately captures the essence and the meaning of the original Urdu text without any omissions or additions. The English translation maintains both the style and tone of the Urdu input. The phrase 'میں نہيں مانتا' is aptly translated as 'I don't believe it.' Similarly, 'تم کہا کرتی تھی نا کہ القاعدہ والے بکاؤ نہیں ہوتے' is rendered into English as 'You used to say, didn't you, that Al-Qaeda people are not for sale?' which retains the conversational and interrogative nuance of the original. Additionally, there are no grammatical errors in the English translation.",100
"The output misinterprets and mistranslates the original phrase. The Urdu word 'بکاؤ' translates to 'for sale' or 'can be bought,' implying the idea that they are not corruptible or can't be bought over, but the output translates it as 'don't get tired,' which is incorrect and changes the meaning entirely. Therefore, the translation fails to convey the original message accurately.",20
"The original text 'میں نہيں مانتا ۔ تم کہا کرتی تھی نا کہ القاعدہ والے بکاؤ نہیں ہوتے' translates to 'I don't believe it. You used to say, right, that Al-Qaeda people are not for sale.' The translated output 'I didn't know' completely changes the meaning and fails to capture the reference to Al-Qaeda or the specific sentiment expressed in the original. The tone and crucial context elements are missing, resulting in a significant misinterpretation of the original message.",0
"The translation has significant issues in terms of conveying the accurate meaning of the original Urdu text. The original text says, 'میں نہيں مانتا ۔ تم کہا کرتی تھی نا کہ القاعدہ والے بکاؤ نہیں ہوتے' which translates to 'I don’t believe it. You used to say that al-Qaeda people are not for sale.' The translated output, however, misinterprets 'بکاؤ نہیں ہوتے' (are not for sale) as 'don't talk,' which is incorrect. Additionally, the phrase 'I don't believe it' was shortened to 'I don't believe,' which is a minor but notable grammatical omission in English. The significant error in converting 'بکاؤ نہیں ہوتے' detrimentally affects the meaning conveyed from the original text and introduces a factual mistake about the characteristics being discussed.",40
"The translation accurately renders the meaning of the original Urdu text into English, conveying the message about Allah sealing the hearts of the unknowing without any omissions or additions. The translated text uses appropriate language that reflects the tone and gravity of the concept discussed. There are no grammatical errors in the English output. However, slight nuances in the reflective style of Urdu might be subtly lost in English, but overall, the essence and style are well preserved.",95
"The translated output accurately conveys the meaning of the original Urdu text without any omissions or additions. It retains the allegorical and solemn tone of the source text. The choice of words like 'stamps' and 'seal' appropriately reflect the metaphorical concept of 'مہر لگا دیتا ہے' used in Urdu, which implies a divine action of sealing or marking. The grammar of the translated sentence is correct, and it maintains the structure suitable for the English language. Overall, the translation upholds the context, style, and tone of the original phrase.",100
"The translation accurately captures the meaning of the original Urdu text without any omissions or additions. The phrase 'اسی طرح اللہ ان لوگوں کے دلوں پر مہر لگا دیتا ہے جو جانتے نہیں' is translated to 'That is how God seals the hearts of those who do not know', which preserves the intent and meaning effectively. The translation maintains the religious and somewhat solemn tone of the original text. Furthermore, there are no grammatical errors in the English translation. Therefore, the translation fulfills all criteria: accurate conveyance of meaning, grammatical correctness, and retention of style and tone.",100
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Urdu text without any omissions or additions. The grammatical structure of the English output is correct and clear. Additionally, the style and tone of the translated text remain consistent with the source, capturing the explanatory and somewhat solemn tone of the original. Overall, the translation is precise and faithful to the source text.",100
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Urdu text. It has successfully translated the place name ('پشاور' to 'Peshawar') and the name of the NGO ('سرو مین کائینڈ' to 'Serve Mankind'), and it also retains the structure mentioning that members ('افراد') of the NGO wrote something. There are no grammatical errors, and the style and tone of the sentence is maintained as it properly identifies the entity (NGO) and the action (wrote) without any alteration. The text does not add or omit any critical information which keeps the content's integrity intact.",100
"The translated output properly conveys the location 'Peshawar' and correctly identifies the subject as 'individuals from a non-governmental organization'. 'Sarwar Main Caind' appears to be a transliteration error or confusion instead of an accurate representation of 'Sarwar Main Kind' or any conceivable accurate NGO name. This misinterpretation can cause confusion about the original NGO name. Overall, the translation captures the gist of the original message but fails to correctly transcribe the NGO's name. Therefore, some points are deducted for this error while the general syntax and structure of the sentence does not have other grammatical issues.",85
"The output correctly translates the location 'Peshawar' and the context that it is about a non-governmental organization. However, there is a significant error in the translation of the organization's name. The original text mentions the organization as 'سرو مین کائینڈ' which should translate to 'Serve Mankind' rather than 'Seromian'. This is a substantial meaning error as it misrepresents the name of the organization and could lead to confusion about the identity of the NGO being referred to. Additionally, the role of 'افراد نے لکچھا:' is not entirely clear from 'wrote:', as it might imply a more specific action taken or message delivered by the staff of the organization, which is not captured here.",70
"The translation inaccurately translates 'سرو مین کائینڈ' as 'Supreme Commission'. The correct translation should represent the name of the NGO which seems to be captivatingly translated, or if it is a name it should remain unchanged if it does not have a direct translation. This significantly distorts the meaning and creates confusion about the identity of the NGO involved. Also, 'سرو مین کائینڈ' seems to be either a transliteration error or an incorrect capture of the NGO's name in the input text. The translation 'Supreme Commission' does not match usual name structures for NGOs and suggests a possible misinterpretation. All other parts of the sentence such as the city name and the structure reflecting that this entity is writing something have been accurately translated.",40
"The translation accurately captures the essence and meaning of the original Urdu text. It translates queries about the assumption people with evil deeds have about being treated the same as those who are righteous, which is a direct reflection of the source. The translation maintains the style and tone of philosophical inquiry and moral judgment as expressed in the Urdu text. There are no grammatical errors in the English translation, and it retains the original message without any omissions or additions.",100
"The translation maintains the essential meaning of the original text, effectively conveying the contrast between those who have committed evil deeds and those who are faithful and perform good deeds. It captures both groups' expectations surrounding life and death outcomes, and correctly identifies the claim by the evil-doers as 'extremely evil.' However, the style and tone of the original text are slightly altered in translation. The original text has a formal and rhetorical touch typical of Urdu that is somewhat softened in the English translation, and the specific word 'کفّار' translated as 'infidels' may carry slightly different connotations in English than in Urdu. Furthermore, some contextual nuances inherent in the phrase structure and depth of the original Urdu are simplified in translation.",85
"The translated text effectively conveys the overall meaning of the original text, which contrasts the fate of those who commit evil deeds with those who believe and perform good deeds, questioning the assumption that their lives and deaths would be the same. The translation retains both the tone of inquiry and censure that is present in the original Urdu text. It accurately translates the phrase 'کہ اُن کی زندگی اور ان کی موت برابر ہو جائے‘ as 'so that their living and their dying shall be alike,' maintaining the original's emphasis on the equality or disparity in the lives and deaths of the two groups. Additionally, 'جو دعوٰی (یہ کفّار) کر رہے ہیں نہایت برا ہے' is translated as 'How evil is their judgment!', capturing the disapproval of the false belief held by the wrongdoers. No significant grammatical issues are observed in the translation. Overall, the translation is faithful in meaning, tone, and style to the original Urdu text.",95
"The output successfully captures the main philosophical inquiry and its implications from the source text, but changes the rhetorical style by using a straightforward question followed by a reflective statement instead of the continuous narrative style in the original Urdu. Additionally, some contextual elements typical in Urdu phrasing ('جنہوں نے برائیاں کما رکھی ہیں' closely translating to 'those who have earned evils' and 'نہایت برا' as 'extremely evil') are simplified in the translation to 'commit evil deeds' and 'how evil is their judgment'. The explicit mention of those who 'believe and do good deeds' in their likeness in both life and death has been preserved. The translation omits small details like reference to the disbelievers' claim but retains the core theme and moral contrast between good and evil.",80
"The output accurately translates the meaning of the original Urdu text into English without adding or missing any key elements. The conversational and somewhat confrontational tone of the text is also well-preserved in translation. The original Urdu text uses a respectful form of address ('اے موسیٰ'), which is adequately translated to 'O Moses' to maintain the deferential and formal tone. Furthermore, the translation is grammatically correct.",100
"The output captures the essence and meaning of the original Urdu text well, translating it without significant alterations or omissions. However, there is a slight variation in tone as the Urdu version uses 'کہنے لگا' implying 'he began to say' which adds a nuance of continuation or an ongoing act of speaking, whereas the English translation 'It seems to be saying' suggests an observation of the act, slightly altering the immediacy and directness of the original speech. Additionally, the direct address 'اے موسیٰؑ' is respectfully translated to 'Oh Moses,' maintaining the respectful tone.",90
"The output correctly conveys the meaning of the original text without any change in content. It captures the essence of the speaker's rhetorical question about being driven out of their land due to Moses' magic. The translation retains the solemn and slightly confrontational tone of the original text. Additionally, the English translation also uses an older, more formal style of English ('Hast thou', 'thy'), which corresponds well to the traditional and formal feel of the Urdu text. There are no grammatical errors in the translation.",100
"The translation accurately reflects the original Urdu text without any omissions or additions. The question posed to Moses is translated clearly and maintains the confrontational tone and context of the original scripture. Grammatically, the English translation is correct; however, the formal Arabic honorific 'ؑ' used after Moses' name in Urdu, signifying respect, is omitted in the translation. This could be considered a minor deviation but does not affect the overall meaning, grammar, or style of the translation.",95
"The translation from English to Urdu is accurate and preserves the original meaning and tone of the text. The output '- اور اس گاؤں میں...' correctly translates to '- And in this village...'. The dash '-' used in both texts indicates a continuation of the previous thought, which is correctly mirrored in the Urdu version. There are no grammatical issues or alterations in style, tone, or content. The translation effectively transfers the unfinished, suspenseful quality given by the ellipses in both languages.",100
"The translated Urdu text accurately captures the meaning, tone, and style of the original English sentence. The use of 'اور' translates 'And', and 'اس گاؤں میں' correctly translates to 'in this village'. The ellipsis is also appropriately maintained, preserving the suspenseful tone. There are no grammatical errors, and the translation maintains the brevity and mysteriousness of the original.",100
"The translated output is identical to the input, and since the input is in English with incomplete context, the output retains this aspect perfectly. There is no grammatical error in the translation since it's essentially unchanged. The style and tone are also preserved as the translation includes the contemplative ellipsis and the same phrase. Given that there are no errors or deviations, the output is perfect according to the specified criteria.",100
"The translated output exactly matches the source text which means it is a direct copy, translating from English to Urdu was not performed. Without any actual translation into Urdu, it's impossible to evaluate the adaptation of meaning, grammatical correctness related to Urdu, or preservation of style and tone in Urdu. Thus, it does not meet the criteria set for the evaluation.",0
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Urdu sentence into English without any omissions or additions. The question format and the essence of surprise or clarification about the events occurring in Iraq are effectively retained in the translation. There are no grammatical issues in the English output, and it correctly follows the syntax and structure of a typical English interrogative sentence, maintaining the style and tone of the original.",100
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Urdu text into English without any omissions or additions. It maintains grammatical correctness and successfully retains the inquisitive tone of the original question. The style and tone are appropriately matched, making it a clear and direct inquiry.",100
"The output accurately translates the input from Urdu to English. It maintains the meaning of the original sentence without any omissions or additions. Moreover, there are no grammatical errors, and the tone and style of the question are appropriately retained. The English output is a fluent and natural translation of the Urdu input, preserving the direct inquiry about the events being discussed in relation to Iraq.",100
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Urdu sentence without any omissions or additions. The tone and style of the question are preserved in the translation, maintaining the inquisitive nature of the sentence. There are no grammatical errors in the English translation.",100
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Urdu text without any omissions or additions. The phrase 'اور تم تین گروہ ہوجاؤ گے' translates directly to 'And you will be divided into three groups', capturing both the structure and the essence of the sentence. There are no grammatical errors in the translation, and it maintains a neutral and direct tone, consistent with the source text.",100
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original Urdu sentence without any omissions or additions. The simple future tense is appropriately used ('will become'), and the translation retains the straightforward and declarative tone of the original. There are no grammatical errors in the English output. Thus, the translation effectively meets all the criteria for a high-quality translation.",100
"The translation generally conveys the central idea of the Urdu text. The original phrase '
اور تم تین گروہ ہوجاؤ گے
', directly translates to 'And you will be divided into three groups'. The use of 'become' in English output 'And you become three classes' provides an approximation but slightly deviates from the implied future tense indicated by 'ہوجاؤ گے' (will become). Additionally, the term 'classes' in English might introduce a subtle shift in meaning from 'گروہ' which is more accurately translated as 'groups'. There is no grammatical error in the English translation, but there is minor error in fully retaining the exact original meaning and specific future tense.",80
"The output accurately captures the meaning of the original Urdu text. The Urdu text 'اور تم تین گروہ ہوجاؤ گے' translates to 'And you will be divided into three groups'. The translation to English as 'And you shall be three classes' is acceptable, where 'classes' is used in place of 'groups', both terms can be suitable although 'groups' would be more literal. However, the meaning remains clear and correct. Hence, the translation meets the requirements of meaning and grammatical correctness. As for style and tone, it retains the formal and predictive nature of the original text.",95
