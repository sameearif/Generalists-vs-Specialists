"The translated Urdu text accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence, preserving both the sense of action and the dire consequences of that action described. The phrase 'instills it [with corruption]' has been aptly translated as 'اس میں بدعنوانی ڈالتا ہے', which captures the intent of introducing or infusing corruption. Furthermore, the translation maintains grammatical correctness in Urdu, with proper verb conjugation and subject agreement. The style and tone, which seem to be instructive or morally focusing, are also retained in the translation.",98
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. In the source text, 'And he has failed who instills it [with corruption]' indicates a person's failure due to corrupting something. The Urdu translation, 'اور وہ ناکام ہے جو اس میں فساد لگاتا ہے', correctly captures this idea, indicating the person has failed by instilling corruption ('فساد'). There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation, and it retains the same serious and admonitory tone as the original text.",95
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text, which talks about a person who corrupts 'it' (presumably a moral or physical entity) and hence fails. The Urdu version uses a similar structure and vocabulary that aligns well with the original English text. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation. Moreover, the translation maintains the tone of warning or moral admonishment present in the English text. However, the addition of 'گناہ کا ذریعہ بنا کر' (by making it a source of sin) introduces a bit of interpretation not explicitly present in the English phrase, which could be considered a slight addition beyond the direct translation. Despite this addition, it does help to clarify the meaning without significantly altering the overall message.",95
"The translation has inaccurately interpreted the phrase 'instills it [with corruption]'. The original phrase implies the act of incorporating corruption or negative values into something. However, the Urdu translation 'اسے (آگ میں) ڈالا' suggests actions more akin to 'throwing [it] into the fire', which is a significant distortion of the original meaning. Moreover, 'نامراد ہوا' translates to 'became unfortunate' or 'was doomed,' which, although close enough to 'has failed,' still lacks the specificity of how the failure happened due to the act of instillation of corruption, rather than the consequence of it. The major issue here is the misunderstanding of 'instills it [with corruption]' which alters the intended message. Additionally, the style and tone have shifted from abstract and contemplative to a more literal and punitive interpretation.",40
"The output accurately translates the input from English to Urdu without adding or omitting any significant information. The phrase 'The Pharaoh and his people had also received Our warning' is translated as 'فرعون اور اس کی قوم کو بھی ہماری طرف سے تنبیہ موصول ہوئی تھی', which correctly conveys the subject (The Pharaoh and his people), action (had received), source (Our), and the type of message (warning) termed as 'تنبیہ'. The translation maintains the past perfect tense and the passive voice, thus accurately reflecting the style and tone of the original text. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation.",100
"The translation from English to Urdu has accurately passed the overall message that the Pharaoh and his people received a warning. However, the word choice in Urdu 'پڑھا' (read) does not completely align with 'received' as used in the English text, which could imply a broader sense of acquiring or acknowledging the warning, not necessarily through reading. This slightly changes the nuance of the sentence. Additionally, the style and tone are maintained adequately. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation.",85
"The output text maintains the essence of the input text. The original text 'The Pharaoh and his people had also received Our warning,' suggests a past action where a warning was given by a higher authority (implied to be God in many scriptural narratives) to Pharaoh and his people. The translation into Urdu as 'اور فرعون اور اس کی قوم کو ہم نے پہلے ہی ڈرایا تھا' correctly conveys that the warning was given (implied by 'ڈرایا تھا' which translates back to 'had warned') beforehand but adds a slight emphasis ('پہلے ہی' could be interpreted as 'already' or 'beforehand'), which though not present in the English input, does not change the overall meaning significantly. It still effectively communicates the original message without grammatical errors and retaining a similar tone, thus fulfilling the criteria for a good translation.",95
"The translated text accurately conveys the meaning of the original phrase, 'The Pharaoh and his people had also received Our warning,' with the Urdu output 'اور فرعون اور اس کی قوم کو بھی ہماری طرف سے ڈرایا گیا تھا'. The style and tone match well, maintaining a serious and formal tone. The translation 'ڈرایا گیا تھا' effectively conveys 'had received Our warning,' emphasizing the warning aspect. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu sentence.",100
"The translation accurately captures the essence and meaning of the original English text, translating 'We've come a long way from where we began' to a version that retains the sentiment of progress from a starting point. The Urdu translation 'ہم نے اپنی شروعات کی جگہ سے اب تک بہت طویل سفر طے کیا ہے' is grammatically correct and uses appropriate vocabulary. The style and tone of contemplative progress are well-maintained in the translation.",95
"The original text 'We've come a long way from where we began' is expressed in Urdu as 'ہم نے اپنے شروع سے بہت دور آ گئے ہیں'. The translation captures the meaning fully by indicating a significant distance traveled from the starting point, both physically or metaphorically. The phrase 'اپنے شروع سے' translates directly as 'from our start', which correctly conveys 'from where we began'. The structure of the sentence in Urdu is grammatically correct, and it appropriately retains the reflective and somewhat nostalgic tone of the original sentence.",100
"The translated output 'ہم سے شروع سے آگے بڑھ چکے ہیں' does convey the basic meaning of having progressed from the start, similar to the original text. However, the translation contains a slight error. The phrase 'ہم سے شروع سے' might suggest 'from us from the beginning', which introduces an unnecessary repetition and a deviation in clarity compared to 'ہم جہاں سے شروع ہوئے تھے', which clearly aligns with 'from where we began'. Furthermore, the translation lacks the phrase equivalent to 'a long way', which emphasizes the extent of progress and is crucial to the sentiment of the original sentence. Style and tone are generally maintained, but the omission affects the completeness of the conveyed idea.",70
"The translation effectively conveys the overall meaning of the original sentence 'We've come a long way from where we began' by indicating progress from the starting point. The structure and tone are preserved without any grammatical errors. The translated text maintains the reflective tone of the original sentence, and the use of 'طویل راستہ' accurately reflects 'a long way', emphasizing the long journey. Despite slight differences in phrasing, the core message and style remain intact.",95
"The translation accurately conveys the original text's meaning, questioning whether someone possesses the knowledge of the unseen that enables him to see. The Urdu translation maintains the interrogative tone and style of the original English text, using appropriate structure and phrasing ('کیا', 'تاکه', 'دیکھ سکے؟') that corresponds to the intended meaning. There are no omissions or additions, and the grammar is correct in the Urdu translation. Therefore, it effectively meets all the specified criteria for a high-quality translation.",100
"The translation is fairly inaccurate in representing the original query. The original sentence is asking two aspects: a question about someone's knowledge of the unseen and their ability to see it. The translated output, however, phrases it incorrectly as 'کیa وہ نہیں جانتa کہ نہیں دیکھ سکتا؟' which more directly translates to 'Does he not know that he cannot see?' This alteration changes the intended meaning significantly by assuming the person does not know and cannot see, rather than questioning their knowledge of the unseen and their sight. Additionally, there are no grammatical issues in the Urdu output itself, but it fails in terms of conveying the original message as posed in English.",25
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English text, capturing the intent and questioning tone. The sentence structure in Urdu is grammatically correct and the translation does not miss any information nor does it introduce any unnecessary additions. However, the translation subtly alters the tone by not perfectly capturing the original’s construction of 'so that he can see', which implies a conditional ability in seeing the Unseen. The Urdu translation 'کہ وہ دیکھ رہا ہے' translates back to English as 'that he is seeing', which slightly modifies the conditional aspect to a more ongoing or definite action. This is a slight deviation in the style and tone.",90
"The output correctly translates the input conveying the meaning accurately. The phrase 'What! Has he knowledge of the Unseen' is translated to 'کیا اس کے پاس غیب کا علم ہے' which captures the astonishment and the question about possessing knowledge of the unseen accurately. However, the second part of the sentence in the output 'کہ وہ دیکھ رہا ہے' translates to 'that he is seeing' which deviates slightly from the original text, 'so that he can see?'. The conditional or potential nature 'can see' is missing, as 'دیکھ رہا ہے' suggests a present continuous action, not a potential capability. Therefore, there is a minor error in capturing the exact modal quality of the original text.",85
"The translated Urdu text accurately conveys the message of the original English text without any omissions or additions. The phrase 'These are the signs of Allah, which We recite to you in truth' is aptly translated as 'یہ اللہ کی نشانیاں ہیں جو ہم تمہارے سامنے سچائی سے بیان کرتے ہیں', capturing both the essence and specifics of what is being communicated. Similarly, 'and Allah does not desire any wrong for the creatures' is well translated to 'اور الله مخلوق کے لئے کسی ظلم کہ خواہش نہیں رکچتا'. There are no grammatical errors, and the style and tone of the original text are retained in the Urdu translation.",100
"The translation maintains the essence of the original text, conveying the message about the signs of Allah being recited truthfully without the intention of causing wrong. The phrase 'Allah does not desire any wrong for the creatures' has been slightly altered in translation to 'اللہ نے کوئی نہیں چاہا کہ کوئی مخلوق پر ظلم کرے' (Allah did not want anyone to oppress any creature), which shifts the emphasis slightly but retains the core meaning. No major grammatical errors are present, and the formal and venerating tone is well-preserved in the Urdu version.",90
"The translation correctly communicates the idea that these are 'signs of Allah' being recited truthfully. However, there is a slight deviation in capturing the essence of 'Allah does not desire any wrong for the creatures.' The translation shifts this to 'Allah's intent is that there be no oppression upon the people of the world,' which changes the nuance from 'any wrong' to specifically 'oppression' and from 'creatures' to 'people of the world.' Although this maintains the general intent that Allah wishes no harm, such specific wording alters the broad original meaning slightly. The grammatical structure in Urdu is correct, and the style of religious discourse is well preserved.",85
"The translation presented accurately conveys the meaning of the original text. It maintains the essence and context of each element, without introducing any stylistic or grammatical errors. The translation 'یہ اللہ کی آیتیں ہیں جو ہم تمہیں حق کے ساتھ پڑھ کر سناتے ہیں اور اللہ جہان والوں پر ظلم نہیں چاہتا' successfully transfers all details like, Allah's signs, recitation in the truth, and emphasizes Allah's lack of desire for wrong onto creatures by using the term 'جہان والون' for 'creatures'. The translation is done smoothly, retaining the essence and seriousness of the statement regarding divine communication and intent, aligning well in tone with the original. The stylistic choice of words such as 'ظلم نہیں چاہتا' is appropriate for 'does not desire any wrong', effectively preserving the original tone and message.",97
"The translation maintains the main message of the original text and conveys it correctly. The use of phrases like 'زمین میں بلاوجہ خوشیاں مناتے' correctly captures 'exult upon the earth without right', and 'تم غرور سے پیش آتے تھے' accurately reflects 'you used to behave insolently.' The translation successfully maintains the style and tone of the original text, delivering the admonitory tone conveyed by the angels in the source text. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation.",98
"The original phrase refers to the angels speaking, but the translated output incorrectly uses 'انجیل' which means 'Gospel' instead of 'فرشتے' which would correctly translate to 'angels'. The phrase 'تم نے اپنے آپ کو بےقصہ بنا رکھا تھا' attempts to translate 'you used to behave insolently' but the word 'بےقصہ' is incorrect here, it does not reflect 'insolently'. 'بےقصہ' literally means 'without any reason', which doesn’t carry the connotation of arrogance or insult implied in 'insolently'. The translation of 'you used to exult upon the earth without right' to 'تم نے زمین پر بےجا خوشی کرت۔ے تھے' is acceptable, although 'بےجا خوشی' is a slightly informal expression that might not perfectly match the more formal original tone. Overall, there are significant errors in word choice and some deviation from the original tone.",35
"The translation captures the general meaning of the original text but introduces inaccuracies and changes in expression. The original emphasizes 'exulting without right' and 'behaving insolently.' The translation changes 'exult' to 'خوشیاں منایا کرتے تھے' (celebrate with happiness), which dilutes the negative connotation of 'exulting'. The phrase 'you used to behave insolently' is inaccurately translated as 'تم اِطاعت گزار بن کر آگے نہیں نکلے' (you did not move forward by being obedient), completely changing the meaning as 'insolently' and 'being obedient' are opposites. This results in the failure to convey the original criticism of arrogance. Additionally, the connection and structure of the sentence are somewhat preserved, but the key elements of tone and meaning are significantly lost due to the translation errors.",40
"The translation successfully conveys the meaning of the original text, maintaining the core message that the angels attribute the rebuke to wrongful exultation and insolent behavior on Earth. The Urdu translation uses appropriate terms like 'ناحق خوشیاں مناتے' (exulting without right) and 'تکبر کیا کرتے' (used to behave insolently), which effectively capture the essence of the incorrect behaviors highlighted in the original text. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation, and it manages to retain the admonishing tone of the original text. The conversational context indicated by 'That was because' is neatly encapsulated with 'یہ اس لئے کہ', which connects well with the subsequent explanation.",98
"The translation effectively communicates the essential information of the original English text. The phrase 'government sources report' has been aptly translated into 'حکومتی ذرائع کے مطابق'. Moreover, 'recent assessments of money will not affect' is decently translated to 'حالیہ جائزہ لیے گئے رقم پر کوئی اثر نہیں پڑے گا', though the verb tense and sentence structure could be more polished to align perfectly with Urdu syntax. The phrase 'لیے گئے رقم' might be better as 'لی گئی رقم کا' for clarity and grammatical correctness. Despite this slight deviation, the translation manages to retain the meaning without any significant information being omitted or unjustly added. The style and tone, indicated by ellipses for trailing or missing information, is similarly preserved.",90
"The translation is partially correct but incomplete and retains a word ('Recent') from the original text in English, which is a significant error as it suggests incomplete linguistic conversion. This affects both the comprehensibility and the retention of style and tone, since the untranslated word disrupts the flow and consistency of the Urdu language text. Additionally, the use of '... کو متاثر نہیں کیا' without specifying what is not affected makes the sentence incomplete and vague. It also includes an ellipsis at the beginning and towards the end, which aligns with the original text in terms of style but does not compensate for the other errors.",40
"The translation of the input text into Urdu is partially correct but lacks completion and clarity in conveying the full message. The phrase 'recent assessments of money will not affect' is translated only partially; 'حالیہ اموال کی تجزیے' translates to 'recent assessments of money' but misses the critical part of the sentence 'will not affect'. The ellipsis '...' in the translated text suggests an incomplete translation and leaves the reader guessing about the implications of the assessments. Additionally, the sentence seems to truncate abruptly and lacks smoothness, missing a part of the sentence that states what the assessments will not affect, which is crucial for comprehension and context. This results in a translation that conveys incomplete information and lacks full context, which can mislead or confuse the reader regarding the impact of the government's financial assessments.",40
"The translation has diverged significantly in meaning from the original text. The original text mentions 'recent assessments of money will not affect ...', which ambiguously indicates that money assessments won't have an impact on something unspecified. However, the translated Urdu text changes the context to 'نئے پیمانے پر مالی اصلاحات کو اثر نہیں دے گی' (new financial reforms will not affect), which alters the subject to 'financial reforms' and inaccurately specifies it. This deviation presents both a factual alteration and an inaccurate conveyance of the original message. Additionally, the original source was just mentioned as 'government sources' while the translation inaccurately embellishes to 'حکومتی ذرائع ابلاغ' (government media sources), changing the tone and potential reliability perception.",40
"The output accurately reflects the original English input. The translation conveys the intended meaning without any omission or addition. The phrase 'Surely We have made them to grow into a (new) growth' is effectively translated as 'ہم نے یقیناً انہیں ایک نئی نشوونما میں بڑھایا ہے,' preserving both the semantic content and the emphatic tone indicated by 'Surely' ('یقیناً'). The Urdu translation is grammatically correct, with appropriate word choice ensuring both readability and retention of the original's style and tone.",100
"The output correctly translates the phrase 'Surely We have made them to grow' as 'ہم نے انہیں پھلایا ہے', capturing the primary subject and action. However, the translation misses the subtlety of '(new) growth'. 'ایک نئی رشد' translates to 'a new growth' but lacks fidelity with the specific nuance conveyed in 'growth' as it is inherent in 'into a (new) growth'. The words 'پھلایا ہے' (made them to grow) accurately reflect the original text, matching both stylistic and tone elements adequately. The translation is grammatically correct in Urdu.",80
"The translation provided does not accurately reflect the original text. The original sentence talks about a new kind of growth, implying a transformation or development. However, the translated Urdu text changes the meaning to 'made them into bright gardens,' which significantly shifts the context and imagery from growth and transformation to a specific image of gardens. This addition of 'bright gardens' adds details not present in the original text, resulting in a misinterpretation. Additionally, the overall tone and subtle nuances of the original message about transformation and potential are lost in this translation.",40
"The translation 'ہم نے انہیں نئی نسل سے پیدا کیا ہے' translates back to English as 'We have created them from a new generation', which diverges significantly from the original text in terms of both literal meaning and implied context. The original text speaks about growing into something new, implying a transformation or development, whereas the translation erroneously suggests a creation from a new generation, implying origin rather than development. Additionally, the phrase 'made them to grow into' conveys a process of growth not captured by 'پیدا کیا', which means 'created'. Hence, the translation loses some essential components of the original text in terms of meaning, context, and nuance.",40
"The translation captures the meaning, tone, and informal style of the original English phrase accurately. The use of 'تم' appropriately addresses the listener in an informal manner, which is consistent with the use of 'You're' in English. The phrase 'ظاہر ہے' correctly translates 'apparently', adding the necessary emphasis implied in the original text. There are no grammatical errors in the translation.",100
"The translation 'آپ وہاں ہیں، ظاہر ہے!' accurately captures the tone and meaning of the original English phrase 'You're there, apparently!'. The style and casual tone of the original expression is retained, with the inclusion of a comma and the exclamation mark to preserve the emphatic nature of the statement. Additionally, the Urdu translation maintains grammatical accuracy, using the correct conjugation for 'are' ('ہیں') and the appropriate expression for 'apparently' ('ظاہر ہے'). There are no omissions or unnecessary additions in the translation.",100
"The translation effectively captures the essence of the original sentence. The exclamatory tone is maintained with the proper placement of an exclamation mark in Urdu. 'Apparently' is accurately translated as 'ظاہراً' ensuring that the style and subtle nuances are retained. Furthermore, the translation handles the pronoun 'You're' correctly as 'آپ' which is a respectful form in Urdu, thus there are no grammatical errors. Overall, the sentence conveys the same meaning without any omissions or additions.",100
"The output 'تم وہاں، ظاہر ہے!' accurately captures the meaning, style, and tone of the original English phrase 'You're there, apparently!'. The informal tone and the addition of 'ظاہر ہے' (apparently) effectively conveys the light sarcasm or mild surprise inherent in the original. There are no grammatical errors, and the translation also maintains an appropriate straightforward structure, similar to the English version.",97
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'Okay. I believe you.' is translated to 'ٹھیک ہے، میں تمہاری بات مانتا ہوں۔' which captures both the assent and the belief implied in the original. The translation of 'Three minutes.' to 'تین منٹ۔' is precise and direct, accurately reflecting the time specified in the original text. The style and tone of the input, which is straightforward and conversational, is retained in the Urdu translation. Additionally, there are no grammatical errors in the Urdu text.",100
"The output translation has substantial issues with accuracy and grammar. The first phrase 'Okay. I believe you.' is incorrectly translated to '-الرکھا ہے میں سمجھتا ہے' which has grammatical errors and is not an accurate translation. 'الرکھا ہے' does not translate to 'Okay', and 'میں سمجھتا ہے' (I understand) is not the appropriate translation for 'I believe you' which should be something like 'میں آپ پر یقین کرتا ہوں'. Additionally, the sentence structure is incorrect in Urdu. The second part 'Three minutes.' is translated correctly as 'تین منٹ۔'. Due to the inaccurate translation of the first part and its grammatical issues, the score must reflect these significant errors.",30
The translation accurately captures the meaning of the original text without any omissions or additions. The first sentence 'Okay. I believe you.' is translated correctly as 'ٹھیک ہے۔ میں تمہارا یقین کرتا ہوں۔' which maintains the conciseness and the affirmative tone of the original. The second part 'Three minutes.' is translated to 'تین منٹ' which is precise and retains the style and tone of the original text. The translation is free of grammatical errors.,100
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text, capturing both statements without any omissions or additions. The Urdu version maintains proper grammar and the punctuation closely follows the English for clarity and emphasis, particularly with the use of the comma and period. Additionally, the tone and straightforward nature of the dialogue are preserved in the translation.",100
"The translation fairly captures the essence and details of the source text. The term 'he drew lots with them' has been aptly translated to 'اس نے ان کے ساتھ قرعہ اندازی کی' which maintains the original meaning. Similarly, 'was the one to be condemned' has been rendered as 'وہی قرعہ میں منتخب ہوا' implying he was the one chosen or singled out, which aligns well but loses a slight nuance of 'condemnation' or censure. The phrase '[as one to be thrown overboard]' is translated as '[بحر میں پھینکے جانے والا کے طور پر]', which correctly conveys the intended meaning of the original text as someone chosen to be thrown into the sea. The style and tone also match the straightforward narrative tone of the input. The only concern is the slight nuance shift in the word 'condemned,' but it still contributes effectively to the intended meaning.",95
"The original English text uses 'drew lots,' which means to make a selection randomly by pulling straws or tossing a coin, typically to choose who will undergo an unpleasant or undesirable task. The Urdu translation inaccurately translates 'drew lots' as 'انہوں نے ان سے لات مار رکھی' which incorrectly means 'he kept on kicking them' in English, significantly changing the meaning of the sentence. Additionally, 'was the one to be condemned' is translated to 'انہیں سزا دی گئی', which simplifies the context to merely 'was punished.' More importantly, the phrase '[as one to be thrown overboard]' is translated as '[کہ انہیں مرتفہ کر دیا جائے گا]' which would translate back to English as '[that he would be elevated],' which is incorrect. The choice of words in the translation not only alters the original content’s meaning but also omits the crucial detail of selection or fate by drawing lots.",25
"The translated text 'پھر ان کے درمیان قرعہ ڈالا تو وہی (نقصان اٹھانے والا) ہے' is generally correct but loses some important details from the original text. For example, the specific context of being 'thrown overboard' is omitted which is a key element of the original English sentence. While the overall meaning that he was the one determined by lot to suffer a loss is conveyed, the specific nature of that loss ('to be thrown overboard') is not mentioned. Additionally, the style and tone are somewhat mirrored but could be more precise by including the exact nature of the condemnation.",65
"The English phrase 'he drew lots with them' is not translated literally in the Urdu output. Instead, the Urdu translation implies that someone exaggerated for him which leads to his condemnation in a misleading way ('پھر انہوں نے ان کے لئے (کچھ) مبالغہ کر لیا اور وہ (اس طرح) ملامت زدہ ہوگئے'). The essential context of drawing lots which determines random selection or fate is completely missing. Furthermore, the phrase 'to be condemned [as one to be thrown overboard]' has been translated into Urdu as 'ملامت زدہ ہوگئے' suggesting he was condemned to death, which distorts the specific detail of being thrown overboard. The style and tone are also notably altered from a simple explanatory sentence to a narrative with added elements of exaggeration and condemnation.",20
"The translated output closely captures the essence and meaning of the original English text. The overall message, talking about the different reactions of non-believers towards the mention of Allah versus others, is accurately conveyed. The style and tone from the original text, which has a subtle contrast between repulsion and happiness depending on the mentioned entity, is well preserved. Additionally, the grammar in the Urdu translation appears to be correct with appropriate usage of words and sentence structure matching the nuances in Urdu language convention.",98
"The translation has some inaccuracies and distortions in meaning from the original text. The phrase 'believe not in the Hereafter' has been mistranslated as 'نیک نبوت کے لیے یقین نہیں رکھنے والوں', which changes the meaning somewhat inaccurately to 'those who do not believe in good prophecy'. Also, the phrase 'those (whom they worship) beside Him' has been translated as 'کچھ کے ذکر کیا جاتا ہے ', which simplifies the original meaning and does not faithfully convey the implication of worshipping others besides Allah. There are also slight grammatical nuances in Urdu that could be better refined to convey a more accurate and cohesive translation.",60
"The translated text accurately conveys the meaning of the original text without any omission or addition. It maintains the structure and the religious context appropriately, translating each aspect of the sentences and keeping the essence of the feelings described (like repulsion and gladness). It also retains the stylistic elements appropriate for the religious and solemn tone of the text. However, the addition of 'کسی اور' (someone else) for 'those (whom they worship)' is slightly more explicit than the original but doesn't deviate enough from the meaning to lower the score significantly. There are no grammatical errors noted in the Urdu translation.",95
"The translation captures the essence and overall meaning of the original text effectively. It conveys the contrast in reactions of the people who do not believe in the Hereafter based on whether Allah or other deities are mentioned. The nuanced expression 'the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter are repelled' is adapted slightly to 'آخرت پر ایمان نہ رکھنے والوں کے دل الٹ پلٹ جاتے ہیں' (the hearts of those who don't believe in the Hereafter turn over), which slightly changes the metaphor but retains the original meaning. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation. The style and tone closely match the respectful and solemn nature of the original religious context.",95
"The output accurately and faithfully translates the original English text into Urdu, capturing the intended meaning, tone, and religious significance. The message about Isma'il's reliability in keeping promises, and his roles as both a Messenger and a Prophet, is preserved. There are no grammatical errors, and the recreated text maintains the respectful and solemn tone appropriate for a religious text.",100
"The translation mostly conveys the meaning of the original text but includes a minor error and a phrase that doesn't accurately capture the original text's tone. The original text 'Verily! He was true to what he promised,' is translated as 'نہیں! وہ اس کا وعدہ پورا کیا' where 'نہیں!' (No!) is inaccurately added and changes the affirmation tone of 'Verily!' to negation, which is a mistake. The rest of the translation accurately conveys that Ishmael was a Messenger and a Prophet. However, because of the incorrect translation of 'Verily!' and a slight deviation in capturing the tone fully, the score will be reduced to reflect these issues.",75
"The translation captures the essential information from the original text and is generally accurate. However, there are minor deviations in style and a slight error in translating the plural form at the end, which might lead to a misunderstanding of the original context. The original text ends with 'he was a Messenger, (and) a Prophet' implying dual roles singularly held by Ishmael. The translation reflects this as 'وہ وعدہ کے سچے ہیں اور رسول تھے,' which might incorrectly imply the plural 'messengers' due to the phrasing but fundamentally retains the original's message. Furthermore, there's a minor error in style as 'وعدہ کے سچے' could be more accurately tuned to match the source's 'true to what he promised.' Despite these, the translation is free of grammatical errors and maintains respectfulness and a formal tone fitting the religious context.",85
"The output translation maintains the core message of the input text, effectively conveying the mention of Isma'il and his qualities of truthfulness and being a Messenger. However, slight deviations occur in the output. The term 'Prophet' is rendered as 'غیب کی خبریں بتاتا' which translates back to 'teller of the unseen', emphasizing his prophetic ability to relay hidden truths rather than directly calling him a 'Prophet'. Moreover, the phrase 'true to what he promised' is correctly translated as 'وعدہ کا سچا', but there's a slight stylistic shift as the original sentence structure and the emphatic tone set by 'Verily!' ('بیشک') is not exactly maintained in the rest of the sentence. Hence, while the translation is mostly accurate and retains much of the style and tone, minor adjustments could improve the fidelity to the original phrasing.",85
"The translated text accurately captures the essence and specifics of the English input. The key elements such as 'Mexico', 'Viral Video', 'Children', and 'Shake Up Presidential Campaign' are properly translated into Urdu as 'میکسیکو', 'وائرل ویڈیو', 'بچوں', and 'صدارتی مہم کو ہلا کر رکھ دیا'. The phrase 'Shake Up' which can be challenging to effectively translate because of its idiomatic nature, is competently handled in Urdu to convey the substantial impact ('ہلا کر رکھ دیا') on the presidential campaign by the children in the video. There are no grammatical errors, and the tone of a significant political event influenced by a seemingly innocuous source (children in a video) is maintained. Thus, the translation fulfills the criteria of conveying the original meaning without any omissions or inappropriate additions, while retaining the grammatical correctness and original style and tone.",100
"The translation from English to Urdu has captured the essence and meaning of the original text appropriately. The original text's key elements, such as 'Mexico', 'Children', 'Viral Video', and 'Shake Up Presidential Campaign' have been translated into Urdu effectively. In Urdu, 'میکسیکو' translates correctly as 'Mexico'. 'وائرل ویڈیو میں بچے' effectively conveys 'Children in Viral Video'. However, there is a slight variation in the phrase 'Shake Up Presidential Campaign'. The Urdu 'صدارتی مہم میں تیزی لاتے ہیں' is more literally 'bring excitement/intensity into the presidential campaign' rather than directly indicating 'shake up'. Nonetheless, the translation remains contextually meaningful and is understandable. There are no grammatical errors, and the style and tone are consistent with the casual and informative nature of the source text.",90
"The translation conveys the main idea of the original text but has grammatical inaccuracies and a slight alteration in meaning. The phrase 'Children in Viral Video' is translated inaccurately as 'چلتی بچیاں' ('walking children') instead of 'وائرل ویڈیو میں بچے' ('children in viral video'), which indicates the viral nature of the video. The word 'Shake Up' is translated as 'تیز ہوئی' which means 'sped up' or 'accelerated,' rather than the actual meaning of causing a disturbance or a significant impact ('ہل چکی'). The tone and style of urgency/disruption in the original headline are somewhat retained but the wording is not as impactful due to misinterpretation. Therefore, the score reflects these translation issues.",60
"The output translated 'Mexico: Children in Virial Video Shake Up Presidential Campaign' to 'میکسیکو: ویڈیو میں بچے صدر کے مہم کو ہلا ہلا'. The translation seems appropriate but slightly incorrect. The word 'viral' in 'viral video' which implies the video's widespread recognition and popularity on the internet, is directly translated to 'ویڈیو' which simply means 'video' in Urdu, losing the essence of its widespread impact. Additionally, the translation 'ہلا ہلا' is a bit informal and vague; it does not exactly convey 'shake up', which implies a significant impact or disturbance. The word should convey more of a powerful impact to mirror the original meaning more closely and the verb tense should be refined to better match the original headline's style which is meant to be sharp and impactful. The style and tone are partly preserved but could be more precise.",70
"The translation captures the meaning of the original text well, including the emotional nuances. The phrase 'Eyes lowered, shame attending' has been effectively translated as 'آنکھیں جھکی ہوئی، شرمندگی ان کا ساتھ دے رہی ہے' which retains the imagery and the feeling of shame. The second sentence 'That is the day they have been promised!' is also accurately translated to 'وہ وہی دن ہے جس کا انہیں وعدہ دیا گیا تھا!', which correctly conveys the future promise and expectation. The tone and style are maintained, and there are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation.",100
"The output translation has several issues affecting its quality. Firstly, 'Eyes lowered, shame attending' is translated inaccurately as 'آنکھیں گھٹے ہوئے ہonte کا ہے' which includes a transliteration error with the word 'honte' which seems to be an incorrect attempt at writing 'shame' in Urdu. The correct translation for 'shame attending' would involve proper Urdu words without transliteration errors. Secondly, the phrase 'That is the day they have been promised!' is translated as 'وہ دن ہے جو انہیں لیا گیا ہے!' which includes a misinterpretation; a more accurate translation might be 'یہ وہ دن ہے جس کا ان سے وعدہ کیا گیا تھا'. Moreover, the sentence structure and the use of 'لیا گیا' changes the intended meaning slightly and makes it less fluent. Overall, the translation struggles with accuracy and word choice, affecting both the conveyance of the original meaning and the grammatical integrity.",30
"The translation effectively captures the original meaning. The phrase 'Eyes lowered, shame attending' has been translated to 'نگاہیں اُن کی جھکی ہوئی ہوں گی، اور اُن پر ذلت چھا رہی ہو گی' emphasizing both the physical gesture of 'eyes lowered' and the emotional state 'shame'. The structural shift to passive voice appropriately aligns with Urdu conventions enhancing clarity. 'That is the day they have been promised!' is translated as 'یہی وہ دن ہے جس کا وعدہ کئے جاتے ہیں', which retains the original's implication of a fateful or significant future event with fidelity and clarity. There is no grammatical error, and the tone and style of the original text are maintained, ensuring the translation reads both poetically and with gravitas as intended in the source.",95
"The translation accurately and effectively captures the essence and tone of the original text. The phrase 'Eyes lowered, shame attending' is translated as 'نگاہیں نیچی ہوں گی اور ذلت چھائے گی', which retains both the imagery and the demeanor of humility and disgrace. The latter part of the sentence, 'That is the day they have been promised!' is rendered as 'یہی وہ دن ہے جس کا ان سے وعدہ کیا جاتا تھا', which appropriately conveys the prophetic and solemn tone of the original text, indicating the fulfillment of a promise or a warning. There are no grammatical errors, and the translation respects the urgency and gravity of the original statement.",95
"The translated Urdu text captures the essence and meaning of the original English sentence effectively. It accurately conveys Moses reaching an age of maturity, and being bestowed with wisdom and knowledge by a higher power. Furthermore, the translator maintains the religious and formal tone of the text, which is appropriate given the context. The translation also follows Urdu grammatical structure correctly and uses appropriate vocabulary. The phrase 'Thus do We reward those who do good' has been aptly translated into 'اس طرح ہم نیکوکاروں کو انعام دیتے ہیں', maintaining the causative and rewarding tone of the original text. However, there's a minor redundancy in Urdu - 'جوانی کی پوری عمر کو پہنچا اور بلوغت کو پہنچے', where 'جوانی' and 'بلوغت' may seem slightly repetitive as they both refer to reaching maturity. This could be streamlined for more concise communication.",90
"The translated output accurately captures the meaning of the original English text without any omissions or additions. The phrase 'We bestowed upon him wisdom and knowledge' is appropriately translated as 'ہم نے اس پر حکمت اور علم عطا کیا', maintaining the core message. The style and tone, reflective of a respectful and formal narrative suitable for historical or religious texts, are preserved in Urdu translation. The sentence structure in the translation is correct, and the grammatical integrity is upheld. The concluding phrase in the output, 'اس طرح ہم نے اچھے کام کرنے والوں کو انعام دیتے ہیں', correctly corresponds to the original text's 'Thus do We reward those who do good', maintaining the narrative style and context.",100
"The translated Urdu text faithfully conveys the meaning of the original English sentence with minor stylistic adjustments that are appropriate for the language. The core message, that Moses was bestowed with wisdom and knowledge upon maturity, is preserved. The phrase 'نبوّت' (prophethood) is added in the parenthesis, which, although not present in the English version, adds a contextual Islamic perspective that is familiar to the target audience. Such additions are common in translations to enhance comprehension and relate to cultural and religious contexts in Urdu. The last part of the translation aligns with the original message of rewarding the virtuous. No grammatical errors are evident in the translation.",95
"The translated text accurately communicates the context and the message of the original input text. There is a slight repetition 'اپنی جوانی کو پہنچے اور پوری جوانی کو پہنچے' which translates to 'reached his youth and grew to full youth', which is a bit redundant and could potentially affect the quality by being unnecessarily verbose. However, the main spiritual context is retained, mentioning wisdom (حکمت) and knowledge (علم) being bestowed, which aligns well with 'We bestowed upon him wisdom and knowledge.' The phrase 'Thus do We reward those who do good' is also translated accurately as 'ہم نیکوکاروں کو اسی طرح بدلہ دیا کرتے ہیں', maintaining the moral and religious connotation. Therefore, overall, the translation is accurate but slight text redundancy somewhat affects the quality.",90
"The translated output 'ہمیں اوپر جانا ہے' accurately conveys the meaning of the original text 'WE HAVE TO GET HIGHER.' The word 'اوپر' (higher/up) correctly translates the sense of elevation implied in 'HIGHER,' and 'ہمیں ... جانا ہے' (we have to go) appropriately represents 'WE HAVE TO GET.' There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation, and the imperative and somewhat urgent tone of the English sentence is preserved in the Urdu version. The style, being direct and concise, is also well-retained.",100
"The translation of the input text 'WE HAVE TO GET HIGHER.' to Urdu as 'ہم اپنی چھوٹیوں کو بلند کریں' is incorrect. The accurate translation should have been close to 'ہمیں زیادہ اونچائی حاصل کرنی ہے' or a similar version depending upon the context, implying the need to achieve a greater height or level. The output rendered in Urdu includes 'چھوٹیوں' which translates back into English as 'smalls' or 'juniors,' thus misrepresenting the meaning of 'higher.' Additionally, the phrase 'کو بلند کریں' suggests an action of lifting or elevating others, adding a different dimension to the sentence which was not present in the original text. Therefore, this translation alters the meaning, introduces additional concepts not present in the original, and has grammatical issues.",20
"The translation of 'WE HAVE TO GET HIGHER.' to 'ہم ہیں زیادہ ہونا چاہیے.' is somewhat inaccurate. The original statement 'WE HAVE TO GET HIGHER.' conveys an imperative need to increase or elevate in position or status. The translated version 'ہم ہیں زیادہ ہونا چاہیے.' is grammatically incorrect and translates loosely to 'we have to be more,' which not only loses the specificity of 'getting higher' but also fails to incorporate the original connotation correctly. Furthermore, the verb form and usage in Urdu do not align properly with the standard grammar and the original sentence's tone which is directive.",30
"The output translation contains a grammatical mistake and awkward wording in Urdu. The correct version could be 'ہمیں اونچائی حاصل کرنی ہے' depending on the context (literal or metaphorical). The phrase 'کرنے کے لئے ہے' directly translates back to 'is to be obtained' which lacks the straightforward imperative mood of the original English sentence. Furthermore, the word 'بلند' (high/tall) alone doesn't convey 'higher' effectively without further context or construction in Urdu.",40
"The translated text accurately conveys the meaning of the original English input without adding or omitting significant details. It retains the metaphorical and somewhat abstract nature of the original text, reflecting the symbolic action of stretching a rope towards heaven. The translation also maintains the style and tone, creating a thought-provoking and slightly mystic feeling around the consequences of doubting divine assistance. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation. It captures all essential elements of the English version, preserving both the literal and figurative nuances.",95
"The translation has multiple issues. Firstly, the phrase 'thinks God will not help him' is not correctly translated; The Urdu translation is incorrect and confused in grammatical structure. The part mentioning 'in the present world and the world to come' is translated too loosely with 'یہ دنیا میں اور آئندہ میں' which structurally and stylistically misses the original's conciseness and orderliness. The phrase 'let him stretch up a rope to heaven' is awkwardly translated as 'اس کو آسمان میں ایک سلاخ لگا دو', which inaccurately uses 'سلاخ' for rope and confusingly suggests installing rather than stretching. The sentence structure also changes the implied subject, making it confusing. Lastly, 'his guile does away with what enrages him' is translated as 'اس کی چال کیا اس کی خفا کو ختم کرتی ہے', where the grammatical structure ('کیا' usage is incorrect and disrupts the understanding and 'خفا' isn’t the best choice for what 'enrages him') leads to a loss of the original meaning and tone, which is significantly more profound and metaphoric. The overall translation poorly reflects the original text’s meaning, style, and tone.",30
"The translation inaccurately conveys the meaning of the original text. The phrase 'let him stretch up a rope to heaven' has been mistranslated to 'زمین میں کوئی سوت (سلا) لے آئیں', mixing up 'to heaven' with 'in the earth'. Furthermore, 'then let him sever it' is transformed incorrectly to 'پھر (خود) اُبھار کر توڑ دیں' which changes the meaning and implies self-raising rather than cutting the rope as intended. Additionally, the original message is regarding God's aid, but the translated version wrongly implies that God cannot help at all ('خدا ان کو دنیا اور آخرت میں کچھ بھی نہیں سکتا'), which incorrectly adds information that alters the theological tone of the text. This neglects the original nuance related to testing God's help through an action. Additionally, there are grammatical issues and the tone deviates from a philosophically and theologically reflective to a more straightforward and accusative tone.",30
"The translation captures the essence and the meaning of the original text, rendering the metaphorical and religious nuances effectively into Urdu. The translation retains the structure of suggesting an improbable task to emphasize the futility and absurdity of doubting divine assistance, mirroring the rhetorical style of the original. However, there is a slight deviation in the translation of 'let him sever it' which is translated to imply stretching the rope to heaven rather than cutting it after stretching. This could slightly alter the perceived meaning. Nevertheless, the tone and formality are well preserved, and there are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation.",90
"The output largely preserves the original message, translating the various provisions made by Allah as described in the text, including shades, retreat places in mountains, and coats for protection against heat and violence. There’s a slight addition with 'پیدائش' (creation) for specificity that isn’t directly in the original text but fits the context. The translation maintains the respectful and solemn tone of the original. However, the translation 'پوشاک' for 'coats' less accurately conveys the protection aspect emphasized in the original English text, as it generally means 'clothing' in a broader sense, thus slightly diminishing the specificity of protection against heat and violence. Additionally, the phrase 'ہے' is used repeatedly for 'hath appointed' which is grammatically redundant in Urdu because repeating verbs in such contexts isn't necessary. Despite these nuances, the overall translation is quite faithful and grammatically correct.",85
"The translated text presents a few issues in grammar and word choice that impact the quality and accuracy of the translation. First, the phrase 'جو وہ ایجاد کر رہا ہے' should be 'جو اُس نے پیدا کیا' to more accurately reflect the past tense and the translation of 'created'. Additionally, the use of 'خلاوں' for 'places of retreat' is not the most accurate term; a more appropriate term might be 'پناہ گاہیں'. Also, 'گرمی سے حفاظت کرنے والی کپڑے' and 'تھانے سے حفاظت کرنے والی کپڑے' slightly misses the nuance; it should ideally be 'گرمی سے بچاؤ کے لباس' and 'تشدد سے بچاؤ کے لباس' respectively to represent coats. Lastly, 'اس طرح وہ اپنی کرم کو تم پر کمال دیتا ہے' could be refined to 'اس طرح وہ اپنی نعمتوڂ کو تم پر مکمل کرتا ہے' to better convey the original intent of 'perfecteth His favour'. These discrepancies affect the tone and the precise conveyance of the original message.",65
"The translated output overall has a good grasp of the essence and meaning conveyed in the original English text but has a few shortcomings. The original text specifies 'coats protecting you from the heat and coats protecting you from the violence', which has been overly simplified in the Urdu translation to just 'سردی کے لباس' (clothes for cold) and 'گرمی کے لباس' (clothes for heat). This simplification omits the mention of protection from 'violence', which is a key detail. Additionally, the final phrase of the original, 'that haply ye may submit.' has been rephrased to 'تاکہ تم اس کی نعمتوں پر شاکر رہو' which shifts from submission to being thankful for God's blessings, altering the tone slightly. This translation, while maintaining the general message and using correct grammar, misses some specificities and slightly alters the tone from submissive to appreciative.",80
"The translated text adequately conveys the meaning of the original text with minimal omissions. The original phrase 'coats protecting you from the violence' is slightly altered in the translation to 'coats that protect you during the time of fight,' which changes the specificity slightly but still stays fairly close in context. The rest of the translation maintains the essence and details of the original English text, such as the creation of shades and places of retreat in the mountains, and the purpose of perfecting His favour to encourage submission. There are no noticeable grammatical errors in the Urdu translation. The style and tone of the translation are consistent with the solemn and instructive tone of the original text.",92
"The output appropriately captures the entire meaning of the original English input without omitting any information. There are no additions either, maintaining the essence and directness of the message. The sentence structure in Urdu is well-formed with correct grammar, aligning with the original content's style and tone. The translation uses the Urdu equivalent for 'needn't' (نہیں ہے) effectively, and the word 'ashamed' is appropriately translated to شرمندہ which correctly conveys 'making one feel shame', fitting the context.",100
"The translation correctly conveys the message of the original text but does not fully capture the contraction 'needn't' which stands for 'need not', making the tone slightly more formal in the Urdu translation. Moreover, the use of 'تومے' seems to be a typographical error; it should probably be 'آپ کو' for better clarity and correctness, aligning with the respectful form 'کریں'. Despite these minor issues, the message that the individual should not feel ashamed for failing the exam is clearly communicated.",85
"The output translation inaccurately conveys the meaning of the original text. The English sentence, 'You needn't be ashamed because you failed the exam,' is advising someone not to feel ashamed due to failing an exam. The Urdu translation, 'تم سے ہمت نہیں لگتی کہ آپ امتحان میں ناکام ہو گئے ہیں,' roughly translates back to 'You are not expected to fail the exam,' which implies a shift in the meaning, suggesting an expectation or assumption of passing, rather than addressing feelings of shame about failing. Additionally, the construction 'تم سے ہمت نہیں لگتی' is grammatically awkward and does not correctly convey the sentiment of not needing to feel ashamed. Furthermore, the mix of informal ('تم') and formal ('آپ') pronouns creates inconsistency. This translation fails in rendering the sentiment, tone, and style adequately.",20
"The translation of the original text has inaccuracies and a tone shift which are significant. The phrase 'You needn't be ashamed' is translated to 'ذلت کا مطالبہ نہیں ہے' which implies 'there is no demand for shame' in English, giving it a formal and slightly altered tone. The correct translation should reflect the casual advice or reassurance present in the original sentence, and a more appropriate translation could be 'آپ کو شرمندہ ہونے کی ضرورت نہیں ہے'. Additionally, the phrase 'because you failed the exam' is sufficiently translated to 'امتحان میں ناکام ہونے کی وجہ سے'. However, the overall meaning becomes slightly off due to the first part of the sentence's mistranslation.",60
"The translated text accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence while maintaining a proper grammatical structure in Urdu. Both the original English text and its Urdu translation emphasize the expanse of the earth as provided by Allah. The Urdu translation 'اور اللہ نے تمہارے لئے زمین کو وسیع بنا دیا ہے' effectively captures the meaning 'And Allah has made for you the earth wide spread (an expanse).' There are no additions or omissions that affect the translation's fidelity. Also, the style and tone of reverence and factual expression are well-retained.",100
"The translated text conveys the essential meaning of the original text, but it omits certain details. Specifically, it leaves out 'wide spread (an expanse)' which is a more poetic and descriptive expression describing the earth's expansiveness. The translation simply states 'وسیع' which translates to 'wide' or 'vast' in English, missing the nuance of 'an expanse.' Additionally, the translated text avoids grammatical errors and maintains a simple narrative style, which is similar to the style of the original English sentence.",80
"The translation 'اور اللہ نے تمہارے لئے زمین کو فرش بنادیا ہے' captures the overall meaning of the original text but changes some of the specific wording. The original English phrase 'wide spread (an expanse)' has been slightly modified in its translation to 'فرش بنادیا' (made into a floor). Though the meaning of 'floor' is close and still conveys the expansiveness, it somewhat deviates from the literal attribute of being 'wide spread'. Also, the phrase 'wide spread' or 'an expanse' has a slightly more neutral connotation compared to 'فرش بنادیا' which could imply something more deliberately prepared or constructed. Therefore, the translation is quite faithful but not perfect in retaining the exact style and tone of the original text.",85
"The translation captures the general meaning of the original English text but lacks the specific wording that conveys the full depth. The English text says 'wide spread (an expanse)', emphasizing the extensive nature of the earth, whereas the Urdu translation uses the word 'فرش' (floor or spread), which simplifies the meaning and does not explicitly convey the expansiveness or vastness as indicated by 'wide spread (an expanse)'. Additionally, the translation is grammatically correct but the choice of words slightly alters the tone and misses the specific nuance provided in the original text.",80
"The translated output conveys the overall meaning of the original English text reasonably well, but simplifies or alters some of the subtleties and nuances. For instance, 'whose life Allah has made inviolable' is translated to 'جس کی حفاظت کے لئے اللہ نے حکم دیا ہو', which slightly shifts from 'made inviolable' to 'ordered protection for', potentially altering the strength of the original prohibition. The phrasing 'except with due cause' is translated adequately into 'سوائے صحیح سبب کے'. The final part of the original text, 'for he has been assisted [by law]', is transformed in Urdu to 'کیونکہ قانون سے اسے مدد ملی ہوئی ہے', which correctly conveys the idea of legal support but the phrase 'for he has been assisted' is more passive than the direct statement in Urdu. The text's overall style and seriousness are maintained, and there are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation.",85
"The translated text has some grammatical and word choice errors and does not precisely convey the original message. Firstly, 'Do not kill a soul [whose life] Allah has made inviolable, except with due cause,' is translated as 'کوئی نفس نہ مارو جو اللہ نے حرام نہ کیا، مگر کہ وجہ شق' which contains syntax issues and inaccuracies in translation ('حرام نہ کیا' should be 'حرام قرار دیا' to match 'made inviolable'). Moreover, the original text’s 'and whoever is killed wrongfully' is inadequately translated as 'اور جو نہ مرتکب ہو,' which changes the meaning and omits the wrongful death aspect entirely. The phrase 'We have certainly given his heir an authority' is reduced to 'تو ہم نے اس کے وارث کو فلاح دیا,' inaccurately translating 'authority' as 'فلاح' which rather means 'prosperity' or 'success.' Lastly, 'But let him not commit any excess in killing [the murderer], for he has been assisted [by law]' is confusingly translated and partly omitted in the output, leading to misunderstanding of the intended legal restraint and assistance by the law. Hence, the translation fails on grounds of grammatical correctness, accuracy, and retention of tone and style of the original text.",25
"The output is a satisfactory translation of the provided input text, capturing the essential message and religious context accurately. However, the Urdu translation could have more directly mapped phrases and structure to better mirror the tone of the original English text. The choice of words like 'جائے عذر' for 'due cause' is appropriate but uncommon, potentially causing slight misunderstanding. Another minor issue is the slightly different expression of 'but let him not commit any excess in killing' which was translated to 'جان کر بدلہ لینے میں زیادتی نہ کرے', using 'جان کر' which implies intentional action and is not exactly in the same lexical field as 'commit any excess'. Overall, the translation is well-executed but not perfect due to these slight deviations in tone and phrase alignment.",85
"The translation captures the core meaning of the original sentence effectively. It stays faithful to the original by instructing not to kill unjustly, acknowledgement of wrongful killing, provision for the victim's heir, and warning against excess in retribution. However, slight modifications in phraseology ('وہ حق کے ساتھ' instead of 'جائز وجہ سے') and word choices ('سند عطا فرمائی ہے' instead of 'اختیار دیا ہے') are present, which could slightly alter the nuance. The overall tone and style of the instruction and caution are retained, aligning well with the serious and formal nature of the subject. There are no significant grammatical errors in the translation.",95
"The translation retains both the meaning and tone of the original English text very well, without any omissions or additions. It captures the essence of prayer and supplication, effectively conveying the concepts of submission, guidance in worship, and divine mercy. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation, and it preserves the respectful and humble tone of the supplication directed towards God. Furthermore, the choice of words like 'پروردگار' for 'Lord', 'مطیع' for 'submissive', and 'فرمانبردار امت' for 'a nation obedient' are correctly used in religious contexts, maintaining the style and dignity of the original text.",98
"The translated Urdu text has multiple issues concerning the accurate representation of the original English text's meaning and grammatical structure. There are mistranslations like 'معتر' (which appears to be a typographical or translational error) instead of a correct term like 'راضی' or 'فرمانبردار'. Additionally, there are spelling and syntax errors, notably in the phrase 'تمہارے لئے معتر کیا کریں', which doesn't make sense in Urdu. The flow and style of the original prayerful, devout tone are lost, and key phrases like 'show us the ways of our worship' are incorrectly translated, losing the depth of the request for guidance in religious practices. Moreover, the respectful and solemn tone of addressing God ('Our Lord') changes strangely in the translation. Overall, the Urdu translation fails to convey the original text's meaning accurately and contains numerous linguistic errors, significantly altering the text's impact and clarity.",20
"The translated output effectively captures the essence and meaning of the original English text. It conveys the request for submissiveness and guidance, mentions the progeny, and highlights the attributes of God as merciful and accepting of repentance. Furthermore, it maintains the respectful and supplicative tone of the original text, and does not contain grammatical errors. However, the phrase 'from our offspring a nation obedient to You' is simplified into 'ہماری اولاد کو اپنی اطاعت گزار بنادے' which loses the nuance of a nation being obedient but is understandable within context. Overall, the translation is accurate though slightly less detailed in this aspect.",95
"The translated text effectively captures the essence and intent of the original prayer text. The request for submissiveness to God and guidance on worship is well maintained. The nuance of 'And make us submissive towards you and from our offspring a nation obedient to You' is accurately translated as 'ہمیں اپنا فرمانبردار بنا لے اور ہماری اولاد میں سے بھی ایک امت کو اپنا فرمانبردار بنا لے', showing a seamless translation of the prayer for both the speaker and their descendants. Additionally, the phrase 'and show us the ways of our worship, and incline towards us with Your mercy' is translated well into Urdu as 'اور ہمیں ہمارے لیے نماز کی راہ بتا دے اور ہم پر اپنی رحمت کے ساتھ رجوع فرما'. The translation retains the original tone of reverence and submission to God. The translation also uses appropriate Urdu terms for religious context which adds to the accuracy. The style and tone remain consistent, and there are no grammatical errors in the translation.",98
"The translation effectively captures the meaning of the original text without omitting or adding any key points. The phrase 'So let the unbelief of the unbeliever not grieve you' is translated accurately as 'پس کافر کی ناشکری سے تمہیں غم نہ کھاؤ', which communicates the original sentiment correctly. Similarly, 'To Us is their return and then We shall inform them of all that they did' is rendered correctly as 'ان کی واپسی ہماری طرف ہے پھر ہم انہیں ان سب کاموں کی خبر دیں گے جو انہوں نے کیے', maintaining both the style and meaning. The part about Allah knowing the secrets hidden in the breasts is translated to 'بیشک اللہ لوگوں کے سینوں میں چھپے رازوں کو بھی خوب جانتا ہے', which aptly reflects the original text's tone and content. The grammar is correct throughout the translated text.",98
"The translation provided has several notable issues affecting its quality and accuracy. Firstly, the beginning of the sentence in the output, 'یہ نبیں نہیں کہ...' translates back to 'It is not the prophets that...', which deviates significantly from the original text talking about the 'unbelief of the unbeliever'. Secondly, the phrase 'ان کا گمان نہیں ہونا چاہئے' incorrectly translates to 'they should not think', which is neither in the original text nor relevant to the context described. Additionally, 'گھسلے ہوئے راز پڑھ لئے ہے' awkwardly states 'secrets that have been brushed read', which is gramatically incorrect and distorts the meaning that Allah is aware of hidden secrets. Overall, the translation fails to accurately convey the original meaning, contains grammatical errors, and doesn't retain the style or tone.",20
"The output accurately captures the essence and meaning of the input text, including all integral aspects. The translation maintains the original's religious and solemn tone, adheres to the grammatical structures necessary in Urdu, and effectively communicates the message without any additions or omissions. Moreover, the translated text retains key phrases intact and aligns closely with the theological context of the original.",98
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text without any omissions or undue additions. All key aspects such as the indifference to the disbelief of the unbelievers, their eventual return, the informing of their deeds, and Allah's omniscience regarding hidden secrets, are properly translated and retained in the Urdu version. Grammatically, the output is correct with appropriate use of language constructs in Urdu, maintaining the formal and somewhat solemn tone akin to religious texts. Thus, the translation meets all three criteria effectively.",98
"The output accurately translates the input from English to Urdu, maintaining the original message without any additions or omissions. The words 'all-forgiving' and 'all-merciful' are effectively translated to 'بخشنے والا' and 'مہربان' respectively, which are precise in Urdu for conveying these qualities of Allah. The structure and tone of the sentence are preserved, maintaining formality and reverence which align with the original text. No grammatical errors are found in the Urdu translation.",100
"The translated text 'اگر انہوں نہیں رکھتے' has phrasing issues and does not clearly convey 'if they desist' from the original English input. The meaning of 'desist' implies stopping or refraining from doing something, which isn't captured accurately in the Urdu translation. The phrase 'عطا کرنے والا' also inaccurately translates to 'generous' or 'giving', deviating from 'all-forgiving' in the source text. While 'مہربان' is a closer match to 'merciful', the misrepresentation of 'all-forgiving' impacts the overall meaning. Additionally, there is a grammatical coherence issue in the Urdu construction. The translation misses the conditional and conclusive connection clearly shown in the original text by 'But if...then...'.",40
"The translation captures the essence of the original text effectively. The key elements, namely 'desist,' 'Allah,' 'all-forgiving,' and 'all-merciful,' are correctly translated to 'باز آجائیں', 'اﷲ', 'بخشنے والا', and 'مہربان'. The style and tone are preserved, maintaining the respectful and formal nature as found in the original text. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation. The phrase 'بیشک' (indeed) enhances the assertion from the original text, adding a bit of emphasis which aligns well with the style of religious texts.",98
"The output accurately translates the content of the input. The phrase 'But if they desist, then Allah is indeed all-forgiving, all-merciful' is translated in Urdu as 'پھر اگر وہ باز آجائیں تو خدا بخشنے والا مہربان ہے'. The terms 'all-forgiving' and 'all-merciful' are aptly translated to 'بخشنے والا' and 'مہربان' respectively, maintaining the attributes of Allah as forgiving and merciful. The sentence starts with 'پھر' ('then' or 'but') which fits naturally indicating a condition that leads to a consequence, aligning well with the original text's tone of a conditional statement. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation, and it retains both the meaning and the respectful tone of the original text.",100
"The translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence, translating 'Why you holdin' up my transport?' to 'تم میری سواری کو کیوں روک رہے ہو؟'. The use of 'تم' appropriately addresses the person being spoken to, and 'روک رہے ہو' correctly translates 'holdin' up', retaining the casual tone implied by the contraction 'holdin''. Furthermore, the word 'سواری' is a correct contextual translation for 'transport'. The grammar of the Urdu sentence is also correct. There are no additions or omissions that affect the meaning, style, or tone.",100
"The translated Urdu output accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The phrase 'Why you holdin' up' is colloquially translated to 'کیوں آپ ... رک رہے ہو?', which maintains the informal tone. The term 'my transport' is suitably translated as 'میرا نقل و حمل', correctly reflecting the possessive aspect and the subject of transport. However, the use of 'آپ' as a formal pronoun contrasts slightly with the informal English original, where a less formal pronoun might have been more stylistically consistent. This slight mismatch in formality is a minor issue and does not majorly affect the overall quality.",95
"The translation captures the meaning of the original sentence but it introduces a slight formality that does not exactly match the tone of the original text. The original text uses 'holdin' up', a casual and slightly slangy expression, which is translated into a more formal and less colloquial Urdu as 'نقل و حرکت روک رہے ہیں'. The use of 'آپ' (a respectful form for 'you' in Urdu) further adds to the formality. Additionally, 'transport' in English has a broader meaning and usually refers to a mode of transportation which is more specifically 'ٹرانسپورٹ' in Urdu rather than 'نقل و حرکت' which is a general term for movement. Therefore, while the translation is grammatically correct and conveys the overall idea, it does not perfectly align in terms of tone and specific wording.",75
"The translation accurately captures the meaning of the original text, conveying the query about the reason behind the delay or stoppage of the speaker's transport. The tone of the original text, which is informal and directly questioning, is appropriately maintained in the Urdu translation with the use of 'کیوں' and the conversational structure. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu output.",100
"The output accurately translates the sentence 'I have to be extremely cautious now.' to Urdu. The key elements such as 'extremely cautious' ('انتہائی محتاط') are correctly translated maintaining the sense of urgency and caution in the sentence. The phrase 'I have to' is translated as 'مجھے ... چاہیے' which properly conveys necessity in Urdu. Additionally, the translation retains the present-time reference implied by 'now' ('اب'). There are no grammatical errors and the style and tone of the original English sentence are well preserved in the translation.",100
"The original text 'I have to be extremely cautious now.' translates directly to 'میں اب بہت محتاط ہونا چاہتا ہوں' in Urdu, focusing on the need to be very careful. The translated text 'مےں اب بہت سنجیدہ ہونا چاہتا ہوں' does not correctly convey the intended meaning of caution and carefulness. Instead, it translates back to English as 'I want to be very serious now,' which changes the emphasis from caution to seriousness. Additionally, there is a grammatical error in the spelling of 'میں' as it is incorrectly written as 'مےں' in the output.",25
"The original text 'I have to be extremely cautious now.' has been translated into Urdu as 'اب میں بہت ہی محفوظ ہونا ہوگا.' The term 'extremely cautious' in English is intended to convey the need for being very careful or vigilant. The Urdu word 'محفوظ' used in the translation primarily translates to 'safe,' which is related but not the exact equivalent in this context. The closer Urdu term for 'cautious' would be 'محتاط'. Grammatically, the translation is correct, but the word choice slightly changes the intensity of the caution implied. Therefore, while the translation is close and understandable, it is not entirely accurate in capturing the exact sentiment of cautiousness.",85
"The output translation, 'میں نے اب انتہائی حفاظت کرنے کی ضرورت ہے.', captures the overall meaning of being careful as indicated in the original English sentence, 'I have to be extremely cautious now.' However, the choice of words 'حفاظت کرنے کی ضرورت' (need to protect) connotes more of a need for protection rather than being cautious. The nuanced difference in meaning affects the fidelity of the translation. Additionally, there is a slight grammatical error in the Urdu output. The correct sentence structure in Urdu should be 'مجھے اب انتہائی احتیاط کی ضرورت ہے', which directly translates to 'I need to be extremely cautious now.' The use of 'میں نے' is inappropriate here and should be 'مجڒ' for correct grammatical consistency. Therefore, while the sentence is understandable, it slightly deviates in terms of exact meaning and contains a grammatical error.",70
"The translated text captures the main ideas of the original sentence. The terms 'forced expatriation,' 'expulsion,' and 'exile' are correctly translated to 'جبری جلاوطنی', 'نکالنا', and 'جلا وطنی'. The general practice of using these methods to get rid of dissenters is properly conveyed with 'مخالفین سے چھٹکارہ پانے کے لئے معمول کی پریکٹس رہی ہے'. However, the translation uses both 'نکالنا' and 'جلا وطنی' which might be slightly redundant since they convey similar meanings in this context, potentially affecting the precision and conciseness of the translation. Despite this, the sentence is largely accurate in terms of grammar, style, and tone, closely matching the matter-of-fact tone of the original English text.",90
"The translation communicates the general idea of the original text, mentioning forced removal or exile but misses some nuances and specific terms. The term 'expatriation' is closely translated to 'قسری باہر کشی', which specifically translates back more directly to 'forced removal' and 'expulsion' is translated as 'نفی' which typically means 'denial'. 'کوڑی ڈھیرے ہٹانے' implies removing rubbish or waste, which incorrectly translates the metaphorical use of 'get rid of dissenters.' Here, a direct mention of dissenters is also missing. The style and tone are fairly maintained, though the choice of words could have been aligned better to reflect the political and serious nature of the original sentence.",60
"The translation incorrectly conveys certain elements of the source text. 'Forced expatriation' was translated broadly as 'جبراً نکال دینے کا طریقہ', which could be understood but overly emphasizes 'way/method' that was not in the original. 'Expulsion' is also similarly translated, creating redundancy. However, the phrase 'has been standard practice to get rid of dissenters' is inadequently translated into 'ہمیشہ کے لئے مجبور کر دیا گیا ہے', which incorrectly implies 'has always been forcefully done' rather than noting it as a 'standard practice against dissenters'. There are also missing contextual terms needed to clearly link the practice to dissenters specifically, which the original text clearly indicates. Furthermore, 'expulsion, exile' were meant to be examples of the broader category of 'forced expatriation,' whereas in translation they appear more like separate, equally emphasized elements. The tone and clear, direct condemnation in the English text are softened and obscured in the Urdu translation.",45
"The output consists entirely of commas with no actual translated text or comprehensible content, making it impossible to evaluate based on the criteria of conveying meaning, grammatical correctness, or retention of style and tone.",0
"The translation captures the essential meaning of the original text accurately, without adding or losing any important details. 'Reclining on beds' is aptly translated as 'بستروں پر جھکے ہوئے', which conveys the same idea. 'The inner coverings of which are of silk brocade' is translated to 'سلکی بروکیڈ کی داخلی ملمع سے بنے', maintaining the description details. The phrase 'and the fruits of the two gardens shall be within reach' is faithfully rendered into 'اور دو باغات کے پھل قریب ہوں گے' accurately communicating the proximity and accessibility of the fruits from the gardens. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation, and the elegant, luxurious tone of the original text is nicely retained.",98
"The translation inaccurately translates certain phrases and introduces some grammatical awkwardness. The term 'Reclining on beds' is translated to 'کھرے بستر پر بیٹھے ہوئے,' which suggests 'sitting on beds' rather than 'reclining.' The style and poetic nature of 'the inner coverings of which are of silk brocade' is somewhat retained in 'جن کے اندرین پردے سیریکے تھانچے ہیں,' but the phrase is awkward and 'سیریکے تھانچے' is not a standard term for 'silk brocade.' The phrase 'within reach' is translated to 'ہاتھ کی رشتی میں ہوں گے,' somewhat correctly implying accessibility, but the typical phrase would be 'ہاتھ کی پہنچ میں.' Typographical errors ('کھرے' instead of possible 'خراد'ے or 'پھلے' instead of 'انگلیوں پر') additionally decrease readability and accuracy. The tone tries to match the original, but these errors hinder its effectiveness.",40
"The translation accurately captures the imagery and description from the original text. The usage of 'تکیے لگائے بیٹھے ہوں گے' instead of 'Reclining on beds' adds a slight cultural flair but retains the same meaning, depicting people resting comfortably. 'جن کے استر دبیز ریشم کے ہوں گے' is a true-to-text translation of 'the inner coverings of which are of silk brocade', maintaining the luxurious imagery. The phrase 'دونوں جنتوں کے پھل وہاں ان کے دسترس میں ہوں گے' captures the original intent of 'and the fruits of the two gardens shall be within reach' showing accessibility. The translation is grammatically correct, maintains the original style, and conveys the intended meaning without any omissions or unnecessary additions.",100
"The output generally captures the overall meaning of the input but introduces specific elements not explicitly present in the original text. The original mentions 'reclining on beds' which is translated appropriately as 'جنتی ایسے بچھونوں پر تکیہ لگائے ہوئے ہوں گے'. However, the translation adds 'جنتی' (heavenly or of paradise) which introduces a contextual assumption not stated in the English text. This phrase seems to orient the setting specifically towards a heavenly or paradisical theme, which, although potentially inferred, is not explicitly mentioned in the source. Additionally, 'inner coverings of silk brocade' is translated as 'جن کے استر دبیز ریشم کے ہوں گے', where 'استر' refers to lining or inner covering, and 'دبیز ریشم' refers to thick silk, closely matching 'silk brocade'. The phrase 'and the fruits of the two gardens shall be within reach' is relatively well translated to 'اور دونوں باغوں کے میوے جھک رہے ہوں گے' implying the fruits are bending or hanging towards, denoting they are within reach. The style and tone are maintained, though some additional contextual interpretation slightly shifts the original emphasis.",85
"The translation captures the main meaning of the original text accurately without any omissions or unwarranted additions. The phrase 'We (now) believe therein' is translated correctly as 'ہم اب اس پر ایمان لے آئے ہیں', and 'But how can they reach (faith) from afar off' is appropriately translated to 'لیکن وہ دور سے (ایمان) کیسے پہنچ سکتے ہیں'. The translation maintains both the grammatical integrity and the contemplative tone of the original text, reflecting a sense of inquiry about faith reaching from a distance. Therefore, the translation adheres to the source text in terms of meaning, tone, and grammatical correctness.",98
"The translation accurately reflects the overall meaning of the original phrase but adjusts some components for fluency in Urdu. The beginning of the sentence 'And say: We (now) believe therein' has been captured as 'اور کہتے ہیں: ہم اس میں یقین رکھتے ہیں,' which is a correct interpretation. However, the latter part, 'But how can they reach (faith) from afar off,' has been slightly rephrased to 'لیکن وہ کیسے یقین لائے گا جو دور ہے؟' The translation assumes a singular 'they' which slightly diverts from the original plural sense and changes 'reach (faith)' to 'یقین لائے گا' (how will he bring/attain faith), which although conceptually close, adds an element of personal action not necessarily implied in 'reach.' Despite these minor issues, the translation retains the interrogative tone and style of querying the possibility of achieving faith from a distance. No grammatical errors are observed in the Urdu translation.",85
"The translation extracts the core message but it misses the exact nuance and structural coherence with the original text. The translation of 'But how can they reach (faith) from afar off' is 'حالانکہ وہ اسے کہاں سے پہنچائیں' which slightly deviates from the original emphasis on faith and the rhetorical nature of the question about attaining faith. The original phrasing suggests a doubt or question regarding the possibility of reaching faith from a distance, which wasn't precisely captured in the output. Moreover, the model output does not directly mention 'from afar off,' which affects the overall conveyed meaning. Hence, while the main idea is somewhat there, the subtleties are compromised.",65
"The translated Urdu text captures the overall message of the original English text, including both parts of the expression - expressing belief and questioning the feasibility of achieving faith from a distance. The translation maintains the structure and splits the content into phrases similarly to the original. However, there is a slight shift in the rhetorical tone in the second part of the Urdu translation. The original text 'But how can they reach (faith) from afar off,' is phrased as a more direct question in English, expressing doubt more implicitly, whereas in Urdu, 'وہ اسے اتنی دور سے کہاں پا سکتے ہیں' reads as a more straightforward question, slightly altering the subtlety of the tone. Nonetheless, this does not significantly detract from the primary meaning but is notable in the nuanced expression and question of feasibility.",85
"The translated Urdu text accurately conveys the meaning of the original English text without any omissions or additions. The phrase 'This is the Day of Decision' is correctly translated as 'یہ فیصلے کا دن ہے'. Additionally, 'which you belied' is properly rendered as 'جس کی تم نے تکذیب کی', maintaining both the grammatical integrity and the tone of the original statement. No grammatical errors are present in the Urdu translation, and it retains the solemn and declarative tone of the original English sentence.",100
"The output accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. 'This is the Day of Decision' is aptly translated to 'یہ دن فیصلہ کا ہے', maintaining the pivotal concept of 'Day of Decision'. The phrase 'which you belied' is translated to 'جو آپ نے منکر کیا', which correctly conveys the notion of denial or rejection, inherent in the original text. The translation respects the original tone, which is declarative and solemn, suitable for the context that appears to be related to a significant moment of judgment or revelation. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation.",100
"The output accurately translates the input sentence from English to Urdu without altering the meaning, tone, or adding any unnecessary elements. The style of direct statement is retained, and the grammatical structure in Urdu is correct. The phrase 'This is the Day of Decision' is translated well as 'یہ وہی فیصلہ کا دن ہے', and the phrase 'which you belied' is aptly translated to 'جسے تم جھٹلاتے تھے', thus maintaining the original implication of denial or disbelief expressed in the source text.",100
"The translation accurately communicates the meaning of the original text with no omissions or additions. The Urdu output 'یہی فیصلے کا دن ہے جسے تم جھٹلایا کرتے تھے' translates back to 'This is the Day of Decision which you used to deny.' The phrase 'which you belied' has been translated to 'جسے تم جھٹلایا کرتے تھے', accurately reflecting the past continuous tense of denial, which closely matches the original meaning. There are no grammatical errors in the translation. Additionally, the style and tone of the original text have been retained, maintaining a formal and solemn tone suitable for the context.",100
"The output accurately translates the input from English to Urdu. It captures the essence and meaning of the original sentence without adding or omitting any information. The phrases 'We only feed you for the sake of God' and 'we do not want any reward or thanks from you' are correctly translated to 'ہم تمہیں صرف اللہ کی رضا کے لئے کھانا کھلاتے ہیں' and 'ہم تم سے کوئی اجر یا شکریہ نہیں چاہتے' respectively. The translation maintains the original tone of selflessness and devotion, and there are no grammatical errors in the Urdu text.",100
"The translated text is mostly accurate with respect to the meaning of the original text. The original text states 'We only feed you for the sake of God,' which is translated to 'ہم تمہارے لئے خدا کی خاطر کھلانے سے' showing alignment in conveying the primary intent of feeding for the sake of God. However, the phrase 'only feed you' has been rendered as 'خدا کی خاطر کھلانے سے' (feed you for the sake of God), which is slightly repetitive in Urdu and might sound unnatural. The second part, 'we do not want any reward or thanks from you,' is fully conveyed in Urdu as 'تم سے کوئی انعام یا شکر نہیں چاہتے,' matching the meaning without omissions or additions. No significant grammatical errors are present, but the language flow could be slightly improved for naturalness. The style and tone are retained consistently, with a straightforward expression of the sentiment.",90
"The output inaccurately translates and extends the original message. The translation adds words like 'حاصل کرنے' (to get) that are not found in the original sentence, and incorrectly translates 'we do not want any reward or thanks from you' to 'ہماری کوئی سزا وارثہ نہیں', which is a misleading statement that does not reflect the original idea of declining reward or thanks. . Moreover, the phrase 'سزا وارثہ' does not make sense in this context. Due to the incorrect translation and added context which distorts the original meaning, the score is low.",20
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text, maintaining the sentiment and purpose behind the statement. The original message, 'We only feed you for the sake of God and we do not want any reward or thanks from you,' is reflected in the translated text without any significant omissions or additions. Furthermore, the translation is grammatically correct in Urdu and retains the selfless tone of the original English, emphasizing feeding for the sake of God without seeking any form of return or thanks from the recipients.",98
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text, including key details about the intention behind what 'Satan casteth forth' being a 'temptation for those in whose heart is a disease and whose hearts are hardened.' The style and tone of the scriptural or formal text are also preserved well in the Urdu translation. Additionally, the Urdu text is grammatically correct and flows smoothly. However, translating 'and the wrong-doers are in divergence far-off' as 'اور ظالم لوگ بہت دور کی بھٹکن میں ہیں' slightly shifts the emphasis—'in divergence far-off' focuses on the state of being far away from truth or righteousness, while 'بہت دور کی بھٹکن میں ہیں' emphasizes being lost or strayed far, which subtly alters the nuance.",90
"The translated text conveys the overall meaning of the original text, but there are a few issues with exactness and structure. First, the phrase 'that which the Satan casteth forth' has been simplified in Urdu to 'جو شیطان نے'. This is a reasonable simplification but loses a bit of detail. Also, 'a temptation for those' has been translated to 'ان لوگوں کے لئے', which fits well. However, the part about hearts being hardened ('whose hearts are hardened') is translated as 'جو دل سخت ہیں', which might be slightly misleading because it could imply all hearts are hardened, rather than those specific hearts. Additionally, 'and the wrong-doers are in divergence far-off' has been simplified to 'اور گناہ گار لوگ دور ہیں', where 'in divergence far-off' loses its specific nuance of being widely divergent or varied and focuses only on the element of distance. The stylistic and tonal aspects of the original text are mostly preserved but could be more precise. Hence, a moderate to high score can be attributed as it meets most criteria but could be refined.",78
"The translation effectively captures the meaning of the original text without any significant omissions or additions. Key elements like 'Satan casteth forth', 'temptation', 'those in whose heart is a disease', 'hearts are hardened', and 'wrong-doers are in divergence far-off' have all been accurately conveyed with appropriate Urdu equivalents: 'شیطان کے پھینکے ہوئے', 'فتنہ', 'جن کے دلوں میں مرض ہے', 'جن کے دل سخت ہو گئے ہیں', 'ظالم لوگ دور ہیں'. The style and tone are consistent with the source, maintaining the grave and serious nature of the sentence. However, the part mentioning 'and the wrong-doers are in divergence far-off' translates loosely to 'اور ظالم لوگ دور ہیں', which could imply physical distance rather than metaphorical divergence. But overall, the translation is solid, retaining almost all nuances.",90
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence into Urdu. It captures the notion of temptation by the Satan, targeting specific individuals with hardened hearts and those who are wrongdoers. The translation also maintains the religious and solemn tone of the original text, appropriate for scriptural content. However, there's a slight deviation in 'شیطانی آثار' translating to 'that which the Satan casteth forth'. 'آثار' often means 'effects' which slightly broadens the original phrase but still relevant. Despite this minor flexibility, the overall translation retains the core message without any errors in grammar. The style and tone are also well-preserved.",92
"The translated output accurately captures the meaning of the original English text, including the clarification in brackets. The output maintains the structure and phrasal integrity of the original sentence. However, translating 'those that swim along' to 'ان چیزوں کی قسم جو تیرتی ہیں' could be seen as slightly less literal, as 'چیزوں' (things) is a bit broader than the possible specific reference to angels or planets. Despite that, the added explanation in parentheses helps clarify any potential ambiguity. Both the style and tone are appropriately formal, mirroring the source. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation.",95
"The translation inaccurately interprets 'those that swim along' as specifically swimming in the water ('سمندر میں پانی میں پھرتی ہیں'), which diverges from the implied broad meaning of moving or floating entities, which could refer to angels or planets in orbits as mentioned. The original text could imply a more abstract or metaphorical swimming, like celestial bodies or angels moving through space, not strictly limited to water. Additionally, the term 'swim along' loses its metaphorical potential in translation. The mention of 'angel' and 'planet' is correct, although the transliteration of 'planets' ('เพลเน็ต') in the output uses non-Urdu script which is incorrect and confusing.",55
"The translation provided diverges significantly from the literal translation of the original English text. The original text mentions entities 'that swim along', referencing, in parenthesis, either angels or planets in their orbits without specifying action like 'stopping' that the Urdu translation includes. The Urdu version, ""اور ان (فرشتوں) کی جو (اﷲ کے حکم سے) تیزی سے (طوفان میں) چلنے والے ہیں (پھر ٹھہر جاتے ہیں)"", adds extra contextual elements not present in the source (such as the surge in a storm and halting), which changes the message. Additionally, it uses 'طوفان میں' (in a storm) which isn't hinted at in the source text. The additional details affect the faithfulness of the translation to the source material.",40
"The output in Urdu captures the general meaning of the original text, which is referring to things that are moving along a path, possibly through swimming. The original English text ambiguously refers to 'those' which could be angels or planets in their orbits according to the provided context. The Urdu output translates 'those' as 'ان کی جو' which roughly translates back to 'those who', maintaining the ambiguity of the subject. The word 'تیرتے پھرتے' can be understood as 'swimming along' or moving fluidly, which aligns with the English phrase 'swim along'. The Urdu text does omit specific clarifications like '(i.e. angels or planets in their orbits, etc.)' which provides examples of what 'those' could refer to. This omission could affect the understanding of the text if the context is not clear to the reader. However, the core idea and movement aspect is maintained. There are no apparent grammatical errors in the Urdu translation, and it retains a similar mysterious and broad tone as the original.",85
"The provided translation successfully conveys the original meaning without omissions or additions. The word 'denied' is appropriately translated as 'کی تکذیب کی', which reflects the denial of the messengers in context. Furthermore, the original text mentions 'the messengers', and the translated text correctly keeps this plural form by using 'رسولوں'. The insertion of 'قوم' also correctly contextualizes 'A'ad' as a tribe, which although not explicit in the English, is implied and essential for understanding. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation. The style and tone are maintained with appropriate formality and clarity.",100
"The input text '(The tribe of) A'ad denied the messengers (of Allah).' is accurately translated into Urdu as 'عاد کی قوم نے الله کے رسولوں کو انکار کیا'. The output keeps the subject of the sentence intact, which is 'The tribe of A'ad', translated as 'عاد کی قوم'. The action described, 'denied', is correctly translated as 'انکار کیا'. Furthermore, 'the messengers (of Allah)' is properly translated to 'الله کے رسولوں', which properly conveys that the messengers are of Allah. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu output, and the translation retains both the style and tone of the original text effectively.",100
"The output translates the original text accurately and concisely, capturing the essence and tone of the statement. The name of the tribe 'A'ad' is correctly used and the verb 'جھٹلایا' appropriately conveys 'denied' in the context of rejecting the messengers. There are no grammatical errors present in the Urdu translation. The style and tone are maintained, keeping the translation straightforward and to the point, which aligns well with the straightforward nature of the original text.",100
"The translation from English to Urdu captures the intended meaning effectively without any addition or omission. The original statement’s style which is declarative, is also maintained in the Urdu translation. Moreover, there are no grammatical errors in the Urdu text. Therefore, the translation meets all the assessment criteria very well.",100
"The output has accurately translated the intended message of the original text I sent not stay in your room?', which seems to be a typo for 'I cannot stay in your room?'. The Urdu translation, 'کیا میں تمہارے کمرے میں نہیں ٹھہر سکتا؟', corresponds well to 'Can I not stay in your room?', assuming the correct intent of the English question. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation. It also retains the interrogative tone of the original text, making it appropriate in style and tone.",85
"The translation provided has several issues: Firstly, the translation inaccurately uses the word 'میرے' (mine) instead of 'تمہارے' (your), changing the subject of the sentence from 'your' to 'mine.' Secondly, the intended meaning of the original text seems to be a question about permission or possibility of staying ('I can't stay in your room?'), which is not aptly captured. Additionally, 'ROOM' is translated phonetically in English and not into Urdu script, which should be 'کمرہ'. Lastly, the Urdu translation structure, though reflecting a valid question form, is skewed by these inaccuracies and the incorrect subject ownership.",30
"The translated output is incorrect grammatically and semantically. The original sentence in English is phrased as a question and likely intends to say 'I should not stay in your room?' However, the output in Urdu translates to 'I did not send (it) in your room?' which completely changes the subject and verb which in turn alters the intended meaning. Furthermore, it introduces grammatical confusion in Urdu as it doesn't specify what was supposedly sent. The translation neither retains the original style nor conveys the intended inquiry about staying.",10
"The translation output is incorrect. The intended English input 'I sent not stay in your toom?' seems grammatically incorrect or oddly phrased as well, possibly intended to be 'I did not stay in your room?' or 'Did I not stay in your room?'. Assuming the latter as a correct query, the Urdu translation 'میں نے آپ کے کمرے میں رہنے نہیں دیا؟' translates back to English as 'Did I not let stay in your room?' which suggests a misunderstanding of the action and subject in the original sentence. The translation incorrectly conveys that the speaker is the one preventing the stay, rather than stating their own action of staying or not staying.",40
"Translation accurately captures the main action described in the original sentence, including the whale turning ('گول گھومتے ہوئے') and presenting its 'blank forehead' ('خالی پیشانی'). However, the translation of 'at bay' as 'مورچے کی طرح' might not fully reflect the meaning intended in the English phrase, which suggests a defensive or cornered posture rather than merely presenting something. Additionally, the choice of the word 'وہل' for 'whale' is slightly non-standard as 'وہیل' is more commonly used in Urdu. Nonetheless, the sentence structure and grammar in the translation are correct, and the style and tone are retained to a large extent.",80
"The output loses key nuances of the original text. 'Wheeled round' implies a sudden or full turning movement which is simplified in the translation to 'کے ساتھ اپنے مقام کو پیش کیا' ('presented his place with his blank forehead'). This translation simplifies the motion and loses the specific action of wheeling around. Additionally, 'at bay' which gives a sense of confrontation or standoff is not translated at all, further diluting the original meaning and tone which suggests a direct and potentially aggressive action by the whale. While there are no grammatical errors, the failure to capture the intensity and full movement reduces the translation's effectiveness.",55
"The output translation is almost identical to the input except for the omission of the definite article 'the' at the beginning. This slight difference does not significantly change the meaning of the sentence, as 'the whale' and 'whale' in this context would generally refer to the same subject. However, the omission could slightly affect the tone and specificity intended in the original text. Grammatically, the output sentence is correct in Urdu.",95
"The translation of the provided text is significantly inaccurate and lacks coherence in its conveyance of the original meaning. The original sentence, 'the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay,' describes a specific action performed by a whale, which is sharply focused and vivid. However, the output text, 'وہ ہائی وے لے کر لے گئے کہ بحر میں اس کی بے ہنگام پیش کرنے کے لئے,' contains words and phrases not present in the original, such as 'وہ ہائی وے لے کر لے گئے' (which implies taking or using the highway), and it does not mention the whale’s action directly. The use of 'بحر' (sea) and 'اس کی بے ہنگام پیش' (present it tumultuously) doesn’t contextually relate to the 'blank forehead' or the posture of the whale in the source. Furthermore, the sentence structure and phrasing have significant grammatical errors, making it difficult to understand. The style and tone of the original which is clear and descriptive, is lost in the translation.",20
"The translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original phrase '* ON SUCH A WINTER'S DAY *', translating it to 'ایسے سردیوں کے دن پر' which captures the essence of mentioning a specific type of day, here, a winter's day. The style and tone are appropriately maintained, with the poetic and reflective nature of mentioning 'such a winter's day' kept intact in Urdu. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu output. The translation is direct and effectively communicates the context of the day being referred to, without any omissions or additions.",100
"The translation provided ('یہ ایک ایسے دن تھا جب موسم زماں تھا') translates back to 'It was a day when winter season was happening'. This does convey the essence of 'winter's day' but misses the poetic tone and style of the original English phrase '* ON SUCH A WINTER'S DAY *'. The original caption style, marked by asterisks which likely suggest emphasis or a special notation, has not been preserved in the Urdu translation. Moreover, the Urdu translation slightly misrepresents the meaning by making it about a specific day ('ایک دن') rather than conveying the general sentiment of experiencing a winter's day. The grammatical structure in Urdu is correct, however, the style and exact conveyance of original meaning are lacking.",70
"The translation of the phrase 'ON SUCH A WINTER'S DAY' to 'ایک زیمر کے دن پر' contains multiple issues. Firstly, the word 'زیمر' does not correspond correctly to 'winter'; the proper word for 'winter' in Urdu is 'سردی' or 'موسم سرما'. Additionally, 'ایک' translates to 'a' which implies a definite day, and does not convey 'such a' which is meant to indicate a specific type or a particular quality of a day. Thus, the translation fails to accurately convey the meaning and it also misses the definite article 'the' which is implicitly present in the poetical expression of the original text. Moreover, ‘پر’ which means 'on' is correctly translated but the overall phrase constructs a grammatically incorrect structure.",20
"The original English input '* ON SUCH A WINTER'S DAY *' has been translated to Urdu as '* ایسے ایک سرمایہ سال کے دن *'. The translation captures the general meaning but makes a critical error in word choice: 'سرمایہ' translates to 'capital' or 'investment' in English, which does not fit the context. The appropriate word should be 'سردی' which means 'winter'. The style and tone with the use of asterisks on both ends is retained, but the incorrect translation of 'winter' leads to points deduction because it changes the meaning.",50
"The translated Urdu text captures the essence and meaning of the original English input accurately. It communicates the concept of a promise made to those who return to Allah and keep His covenant. The translation maintains the religious and solemn tone of the original text, which is appropriate for the context. However, the phrase '[It will be said]' is translated more directly without conveying the implicit suggestion of divine or authoritative declaration found in the original. Despite this slight nuance, the overall grammar and syntax are correct. No additional information is added, and no original information is omitted that would change the overall message.",92
"The translation contains multiple errors and deviations from the original text. The phrase 'It will be said' is not translated, losing a passive construction that indicates a future declaration. The part 'This is what you were promised' is inaccurately translated as 'یہ تو وہی تھا جو آپ کو چاہا تھا'. Here, 'چاہا' is mistakenly used for 'promised', changing the meaning to 'desired' or 'wished'. This changes the implication, as the original text refers specifically to a promise being fulfilled, not a desire. Further, the translation of 'for every returner [to Allah] and keeper [of His covenant]' as 'ہر واپس کرنے والے اور اپنی عہد کی رکابدار کے لیے' while somewhat understandable, uses 'رکابدار' which is not a standard term for 'keeper'. The common and more understandable term 'محافظ یا نگہبان' should have been used. Additionally, the overall tone and formal structure of the biblical-style English is not effectively carried over to Urdu, where it sounds more casual.",40
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text with appropriate phrasing in Urdu, maintaining the reference to a promise and specifying who the promise is intended for, which are 'every returner to Allah and keeper of His covenant.' The addition of '(یعنی)' is a clarification commonly used in Urdu to explain or introduce elaboration, which aligns well with the explanative tone of the original. There are no grammatical mistakes in the Urdu translation. Moreover, the style and tone of the original text, which is solemn and somewhat formal as it seems to evoke a prophetic or scriptural declaration, are well preserved in the Urdu translation.",95
"The translated text captures most of the essence of the original text with appropriate words in Urdu. The phrase 'for every returner [to Allah] and keeper [of His covenant]' is translated to 'ہر رجوع کرنے والے ڈرنے والے کے لیے', which includes 'ہر رجوع کرنے والے' meaning 'for every returner', and 'ڈرنے والے' which can be interpreted as someone who fears, thereby capturing the general notion of a 'keeper of His covenant' through cultural context, though not literal. The overall tone and formality are well maintained, and there are no grammatical errors in the translation. However, 'keeper of His covenant' could be made more explicitly clear to directly reflect the original meaning, hence a slight deduction.",90
"The translated text accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence, asking if someone could call a doctor politely. The phrase 'براہ کرم' (please) maintains the politeness of the request. The structure of the sentence in Urdu is grammatically correct. The style and tone of the original text, which is a polite request, are well-preserved in the translation.",100
"The output text contains a critical mistranslation. 'کتا' in Urdu translates to 'dog' in English, which is a blatant error and not relevant to the original text. The correct word should have been 'کیا' indicating a question like 'کیا آپ ڈاکٹر کو فون کر سکتے ہیں'. The mistranslation fundamentally changes the meaning of the sentence and introduces confusion. While 'ڈاکٹر کو فون کریں، پلیز' correctly translates to 'call the doctor, please', the incorrect insertion of 'کتا' severely impacts the translation's accuracy and appropriateness. Therefore, the score is substantially reduced.",10
"The translation conveys the meaning effectively without any omissions or additions, ensuring the correctness of the request for calling a doctor. The phrase 'آپ ڈاکٹر کو فون کیجئے؟' correctly retains the polite imperative mood as found in the English original, using 'please,' though not explicitly stated, it's implied in the politeness of the phrase. The input and output maintain a polite request tone. Moreover, there are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation.",97
"The translated output accurately conveys the request to call a doctor. However, the addition of 'آپ کو' (Could you) in the Urdu translation subtly shifts the formality and directness of the sentence. In English, 'Could you call a doctor, please?' directly requests the action from the listener, but the Urdu phrasing 'آپ کو ایک ڈاکٹر کو بلا سکتے ہیں؟' translates to 'Could you call a doctor?' without the politeness marker 'please' explicitly mentioned. This slight variation affects both the tone and the precise politeness level of the original request. Additionally, including 'please' in Urdu as 'براہ کرم' would have retained the original tone more faithfully. Grammatically, the sentence is correct in Urdu.",80
"The translated Urdu text accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentences. The phrase 'I've been taken hostage by...' is correctly translated to 'میں یرغمال بن لیا گیا ہوں' which retains the meaning and the suspense created by the ellipsis. The second part 'Fooled you' is translated to 'تمہیں دھوکا دیا' which correctly conveys the playful or joking revelation that the statement about being a hostage was not serious. There are no grammatical errors, and the tone which flips from serious to light-hearted is effectively maintained in the Urdu translation.",95
"The translation provided somewhat picks up on the joking nature of the original text but fails to accurately translate the phrases. The first part, 'I've been taken hostage by...', is incorrectly translated as 'مجھے ہاتھ میں رکھا گیا ہے' which means 'I have been kept in hand', which does not convey the correct implication of being kidnapped or taken hostage. The second part, 'Fooled you', is translated as 'تیری چال میں', meaning 'in your trick', which attempts to convey the idea of being fooled but loses the directness and simplicity of the original statement which is essential to retain the joking tone. Overall, the translation alters the meaning and tone substantially.",40
"The output translation completely fails to communicate the original text's message and meaning. In the original English input, 'I've been taken hostage by...' is followed by a humorous reveal with 'Fooled you,' indicating it was a joke. However, the Urdu translation only covers 'I have... been armed,' which not only incorrectly translates 'taken hostage' (as it ends up sounding as if the subject arms themselves rather than being held captive) but also misses the punchline 'Fooled you' entirely. This changes the overall tone and meaning, resulting in a significant loss in translation effectiveness and quality.",10
"The translation inaccurately conveys the original text. The input 'I've been taken hostage by...' has been mistranslated as 'میں نے آپ کو پکڑ لیا ہے...', which incorrectly changes the subject and implies that 'I have captured you' instead of the intended 'I've been captured/taken hostage'. Additionally, the transition 'Fooled you', indicating a prank or joke, is completely missing in the translation. This error detracts significantly from the fidelity and tone of the original text, causing the output to mislead the reader about the situation being described and omitting the playful reveal.",10
"The translated output accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The phrase 'Which until now has a seat' is correctly translated to 'جو اب تک ایک سیٹ رکھتا ہے' in Urdu, maintaining the crucial elements of 'which', 'until now', and 'has a seat'. There are no grammatical or contextual errors in the Urdu translation. The style and tone appear consistent with the source. Hence, the translation meets all the criteria effectively.",100
"The output 'جس نے اب تک ایک سائٹ رکھی ہے' has a significant error in translation. The word 'seat' has been mistakenly translated to 'سائٹ' which refers to 'site'. The correct translation for 'seat' in this context should be 'سیٹ' (pronounced as seat in English), indicating a place to sit or a position. This mistake changes the meaning of the sentence. Additionally, the translation retains the simplicity and structure of the original text, so it moderately maintains the style and tone.",55
"The input sentence seems to imply a figurative use of 'a seat', perhaps referring to a position or place of authority/influence, which isn't directly addressing a literal chair or throne ('تخت'). The output, however, translates 'seat' as 'تخت' which typically refers to a throne or a significant chair of state, likely adding incorrect context or a tone of grandeur not present or implied in the original English text. This adds to the overall meaning which can be misleading. Furthermore, the phrase 'جو (ابھی تک) تخت پر بیٹھے ہوئے ہیں۔' suggests continuity or ongoing action ('still sits'), which shifts the interpretation. The original English phrase suggests that it 'has a seat' as an existing fact, rather than focusing continuously on the action of sitting. The use of 'ابھی تک' for 'until now' is correct, but overall translation misguides the original intent and style.",55
"The translation of the input 'Which until now has a seat.' is incorrect and inconsistent in the output 'وہ اب تک ایک مقام ہے.'. The English phrase 'has a seat' suggests having an official position or a literal seat, which is not reflected correctly in the Urdu translation. The word 'مقام' means a 'place' or 'position', which does not clearly convey the idea of having a 'seat' in either a literal or metaphorical context. Additionally, the translated sentence structure appears incomplete and awkward in Urdu.",20
"The translation properly conveys the meaning of the original text, effectively translating 'cast them into the sea' as 'ان سب کو دریا میں ڈال دیا', which captures the essence of the original. The use of 'ملزم' for 'blameworthy' interestingly shifts the tone slightly towards a legal implication rather than the direct attribution of fault, but still conveys the original idea. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation. The style and tone overall align with the original, maintaining the narrative quality of the statement.",92
"The translation conveyed the original message reasonably accurately. While the essence of 'casting into the sea' is translated correctly as 'سمندر میں پھینک دیا', it has omitted the phrase 'So We took him'. The direct reference to 'We' which might imply an authority or a collective action is lost in the translation which might slightly alter the perception of the action's initiation. However, 'he was blameworthy' is effectively translated to 'وہ گناہگار تھا' which retains the accusative tone of the original text. Overall, the translation is grammatically correct and communicates the core scenario, but minor contextual elements are missing, affecting the thoroughness of the conveyed message.",85
"The translated text accurately conveys the overall meaning of the original text without any omissions or additions. The Urdu translation retains the narrative clause structure of the original English sentence and appropriately transforms 'cast them into the sea' into 'دریا میں پھینک دیا', which well matches the intended meaning. The phrase 'he was blameworthy' is effectively translated to 'وہ ملامت کیا ہوا تھا', capturing the tone and implication of blame or fault. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation, and the formal, serious tone of the original text is maintained.",95
"The translated text successfully captures the meaning of the original sentence, including all elements without omissions or additions. The phrases 'took him and his soldiers' and 'cast them into the sea' are correctly translated as 'اسے اور اس کے لشکر کو پکڑا' and 'انہیں دریا میں ڈال دیا'. The original text's conclusion that 'he was blameworthy' is also well translated to 'اور وہ ملامت زدہ تھا'. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation, and it retains the serious and direct tone of the original text.",100
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English text without any omissions or additions. It correctly translates phrases like 'lying neglected' to 'ڈھیلی پڑی ہوئی ہے' and 'freshened up and grew forth' to 'ترو تازہ ہوگئی اور اُگ آئی'. The style and reverential tone of the original scriptural-like text are maintained throughout the Urdu translation. The grammar in the Urdu translation is also correct. Overall, the translation meets all the evaluation criteria effectively.",100
"The translation has a few issues that affect its quality. Firstly, the phrase 'lying neglected' is translated as 'چھوڑ دیا ہے' which would directly translate back to 'have been forsaken', losing the connotation of 'lying neglected'. Additionally, 'freshened up and grew forth' is translated to 'نئے رنگ لے لیا اور پھل پھول کیا', which changes 'freshened up' to 'took on new colors', altering the original imagery slightly. Moreover, the end of the translation introduces an error with 'جس نے کچھ نہیں نہیں کیا ہے' which is a repetitive and confusing construction, leading to a misunderstanding. This negatively impacts the accuracy in conveying the original text’s meaning and style.",70
"The translation conveys the overall message of the original text but has some errors and awkward phrasing that affect the quality and clarity. The phrase 'lying neglected' is translated as 'دبی', which more closely means 'suppressed' or 'pressed down' rather than 'neglected'. This can confuse the intended meaning. Additionally, the translation introduces phrases like 'جیسے وہ اس میں پہلے سے تھا اور جیسا وہ اب نکا ہے' which do not have direct counterparts in the original text, thus adding unnecessary information and altering the original style and tone. The translation of 'revive the dead' as 'مردہ کو جلاتا ہے مرے ہوئے کو' is incorrect and convoluted. It should be more straightforward to match the original text. Despite these issues, the key concepts of life, growth, and capability are present, but the execution in translation affects the clarity and purity of the message.",55
"The translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original text without any omissions or additions. The original concept of the earth being revitalized by water and the broader theological implication of resurrection and divine capability are clearly expressed in the Urdu translation. Grammatically, the Urdu text is correct and uses appropriate vocabulary and structure to match the formal and reflective nature of the original. The tone and style are also maintained, with a formal and somewhat poetic language that reflects the gravity and spirituality of the text.",100
"The original text 'All right, let's see you strut it.' is a colloquial and somewhat playful way of encouraging someone to show off their skills or style confidently. The phrase 'strut it' in English specifically conveys showing off with style or swagger, which is somewhat challenging to translate exactly into Urdu. The translation 'ٹھیک ہے، چلو دیکھتے ہیں تم اسے کیسے انجام دیتے ہو' conveys the general idea of performing or executing something but lacks the nuance associated with 'strut it', which includes an element of flair or ostentation. Furthermore, the translation uses 'اسے کیسے انجام دیتے ہو' (how you perform it) which is more general than the original's playful challenge. Grammatically, it is correct, and it does maintain a friendly and casual tone similar to the original.",75
"The original English text 'All right, let's see you strut it' has a casual and slightly encouraging tone, suggesting that the speaker wants to see the other person confidently display or show off something. The Urdu translation 'دیکھتے هیں که آپ اس کو دکھائیں', while it captures the general idea of observing or watching someone, it loses the nuance tied to the word 'strut', which implies not just showing but doing so with a specific style or confidence. Additionally, the translation uses 'دکھائیں', which more straightforwardly means 'show', without capturing the proud or swaggering connotation of 'strut.' The tone in Urdu also feels more formal compared to the casual vibe of the English phrase.",65
"The original English phrase 'let's see you strut it' involves an idiomatic expression ('strut it'), meaning to walk in a proud, confident, and often showy manner. The Urdu translation provided 'آپ کو اسے چلنے دیکھنے کے لئے' loosely translates to 'let's see you walking,' which simplifies the essence and omits the nuanced meaning of 'strut.' Therefore, the translation fails to capture the style, tone, and full meaning of the original text. Additionally, the ending of the Urdu translation is somewhat abrupt and does not include necessary punctuation, which slightly affects the grammatical presentation.",50
"The translation from English to Urdu inaccurately captures the colloquial phrase 'strut it.' In the English context, 'strut it' often implies walking confidently, usually with a bit of an attitude or style, rather than simply shaking or swaying it as suggested by 'ہلا رہے ہیں.' Therefore, a better translation might use phrasing that conveys confidence or showing off, like 'مظاہرہ کریں' or 'دکھاوا کریں.' Additionally, the Urdu sentence ends with a period instead of a comma before 'آپ,' which slightly deviates from the pause used in the original English phrase indicated by the comma after 'All right.' Hence, the translation does not fully retain the style or tone of the original.",65
"The translation effectively communicates the overall meaning of the original text. However, there are several noticeable issues with translation choices and syntax that affect the quality. First, the use of 'ہم خدا کے خلاف جھوٹ بناتے اگر ہم تمہارے دین پر واپس آتے ہیں' is incorrect; a more correct translation would be 'ہم خدا کے خلاف جھوٹ تراشنے لگیں گے اگر ہم تمہارے دین کی طرف واپس آ گئے'. In the original, there is a strong conditional and future aspect which needs to be reflected. Additionally, 'اسکے بعد کہ خدا نے ہمیں اس سے نجات دلائی۔' can be improved for smoothness and accuracy. The phrase 'ہم نے خدا پر بھروسہ کیا ہوا ہے' is grammatically incorrect, as the correct tense and form should be used; 'ہم نے خدا پر بھروسہ کیا' is sufficient. The retention of style and tone from the original text is moderately successful, with formal and respectful language maintained, but the grammatical errors decrease the overall faithfulness to the original text's fluency and profundity.",70
"The translation largely conveys the original meaning but some text has been simplified or altered slightly, which affects the fidelity of translation. For example, ""We would be inventing lies against God"" has been somewhat altered in Urdu to become a future claim of lie (""جھوٹی باتوں کا دعویٰ کریں گے"") which somewhat tweaks the implication of the original sentence. The phrase ""It is not for us to return to it unless God our Lord so willed"" is also shortened and slightly altered to ""ہم خدا کے حکم کے لیے اس میں واپس نہیں آئیں گے"", which shifts the emphasis. Additionally, the translation of ""God encompasses all things in His knowledge"" to ""ہمارا خدا تمام چیزوں کو اپنی علم میں شامل کر رہا ہے"" changes the tense and slightly the meaning. The request for judgement, ""Our Lord, expose the truth [and judge] between us and our people, You are the best judge"" has been mildly adjusted in its feel and formality in Urdu.Tone and style nuances are shifted, affecting retention of the original's style. Grammar is correct throughout the translation.",78
"The translation accurately captures the meaning of the original text without any significant omissions or additions. The key elements of the message are effectively preserved, such as the refusal to return to a former faith, the condition of divine will for any change, and a plea to God for judgment between the speaker and their people. The style and tone of spiritual invocation and submission to the divine will are also well maintained in Urdu. The translation uses appropriate religious terminology suited for the Urdu-speaking audience, maintaining the solemnity and respect characteristic of the original text. Moreover, there are no grammatical errors in the translation, contributing to a very clear and smooth rendition of the original message.",98
"The translated text conveys the meaning of the original text overall but has minor issues related to style and coherence. The phrase 'We would be inventing lies against God' has been literally translated to 'ہم تو اللہ پر جھوٹ باندھیں گے', which could be more smoothly rendered for natural flow in Urdu. Additionally, the sentence structures in the output are a bit cumbersome and less fluid compared to the input. The phrase 'Our Lord, expose the truth [and judge] between us and our people, You are the best judge' seems slightly truncated in the output and lacks completeness. This affects the comprehensiveness and the retention of the original's emphatic appeal. Despite these issues, the major elements of the meaning, tone, and context are preserved.",80
"The translation accurately conveys the message and meaning of the original text without any omissions or additions. The translation properly maintains both style and tone of the original text, reflecting the direct and clear communication of dissatisfaction expressed by Jehan Ara. The phrases like 'political statements', 'flags at half mast', 'gloomy faces', 'said a prayer in the Assembly', 'posters', and 'empty platitudes' have been accurately translated into Urdu, showcasing the original intent and expression. The Urdu translation also effectively captures the personal tone and direct address used in the original English text. Moreover, there are no grammatical errors in the translated Urdu text, ensuring a high-quality translation.",100
"The translated text accurately retains the identities and organizations associated with Jehan Ara while maintaining the critical tone presented in the original. The major issues arise with inconsistencies and unusual phrase choices in the Urdu translation. The phrase 'سیاست کے Statements' mixes English and Urdu inappropriately, which could confuse readers. Similarly, 'آپ کے پرچم نیم چھوٹے ہوں' is an awkward construction for 'flags at half mast'. Furthermore, 'آپ کے مہلک چہرے' translates back to 'your deadly faces' rather than 'your gloomy faces', distorting the intended meaning. 'خلا جھلکائیں' for 'empty platitudes' is vague and does not precisely communicate the original sentiment. These translation gaps and errors negatively impact the conveyance of exact meaning and style of the original. Therefore, the translation quality is moderate, primarily hindered by word choice inaccuracies and some grammatical issues.",65
"The translation accurately conveys the original message and retains Jehan Ara's strong stance against shallow displays of solidarity. The terms used are correctly translated, such as 'پاکستان سوفٹ ویر ہاؤس ایسوسیشن' for 'Pakistan Software Houses Association', and 'بولو بھی' for 'Bolo Bhi'. The translation precisely relays the non-profit’s dedication to 'انٹرنیٹ کی آزادی، خصوصیت اور جینڈر کے حقوق' representing 'internet freedom, privacy, and gender rights'. Additionally, the repetitive structure reflecting Ara's frustrations has been maintained rendering her stance very clear. Grammatically, the Urdu sentence structure and choice of words are correct, making the output readable and fluent.",100
"The translated text has several issues impacting its quality. Firstly, the original message conveyed by Jehan Ara is not accurately translated. Key elements such as the objection to political statements and flags at half mast are entirely omitted. This alters the emphasis and detail of the original statement. Moreover, the context of 'hearing empty platitudes' and 'seeing gloomy faces' is not clearly represented in the output, which changes the overall message. There are also stylistic inconsistencies, such as the transformation of direct, solid expressions into a softer, less direct form which alters the tone intended in the original English text. Additionally, the translation contains grammatical issues in Urdu, such as awkward phrasings ('چہرے بگڑ کر سیاہ پڑے ہوں') and incomplete translation of the sentence towards the end. These errors impact the readability and clarity of the text.",40
"The translation effectively captures the meaning of the original text without any omissions or unwarranted additions. It maintains a similar tone and urgency as in the original. The Urdu translation uses '..' grammatically correct to denote the pause similar to the English text. The use of 'جلدی، وہ آتے ہیں!' correctly translates 'fast, they come!' conveying the urgency and immediacy. Additionally, there are no grammatical issues in the Urdu translation. Hence, this translation scores high on all three criteria.",100
"The output text contains both translation errors and stylistic issues. Firstly, the word for 'gun' is mistranslated as 'گول' (goal) instead of 'بندوق' (gun). Furthermore, 'permit' is more accurately translated as 'لائسنس' or 'اجازت نامہ' rather than just 'اجازت'. The urgency and abruptness conveyed by 'fast, they come!' in English is somewhat lost in the translation, which merely says 'تیزی سے آ رہے ہیں' (coming quickly); the ominous and abrupt tone is not as effectively captured. Additionally, the ellipsis usage is correctly preserved, but the phrase structure changes slightly affect the urgency and style of the original.",50
"The key issue with this translation lies in the mistranslation of the word 'gun' as 'گیند' which actually means 'ball' in Urdu. The correct translation of 'gun' into Urdu should be 'بندوق'. This error significantly affects the conveyed meaning and the accuracy of the context in the original text. Additionally, there’s a minor grammatical error in the structure; the verb conjugation for 'have' in Urdu should align with plural context (ہم), so 'ہے' should ideally be 'ہےں'. Furthermore, the tone of urgency and context is partly maintained with 'تیز، وہ آ رہے ہیں' translating properly as 'fast, they are coming'. However, the mistranslation of the key subject matter, the gun, lowers the overall quality of the translation.",40
"The translation fails to properly convert the verb conjugation from the original text. The correct translation should maintain consistent grammatical structure in Urdu. In the source, 'We do not yet have a permit', the verb 'have' is missing its correct form which should be 'رکھتے ہیں' in Urdu, not 'ہے', which changes the grammatical person and number. Additionally, the urgency and style of 'fast, they come!' is translated, but 'جلدی' could be improved to 'تیزی سے' to better match the urgency conveyed by 'fast'. However, the translation captures the overall meaning and urgency, thus scoring moderately.",65
"The translated text accurately conveys the message and essence of the original English text into Urdu without any omissions or additions. It retains the religious and somewhat formal tone of the original, which is crucial in translating scriptural or sensitive texts. The construction of the sentences is grammatically correct in Urdu, respecting both syntax and semantics appropriate to the language. Additionally, the style of expressing hypothetical scenarios and contemplations has been appropriately maintained, which is pivotal in retaining the contextual meaning reflective of apprehensive or speculative situations. Overall, the translation meets the criteria in terms of accuracy, grammar, and style without deviation.",98
"The translation inaccurately conveys some major elements of the source text. 'AlAhzab' has been mistranslated as 'علیہضب' which is a phonetic error. 'Have not yet withdrawn' is translated to 'نے ابھی نکلا ہی نہیں ہے' which loosely means 'has not yet left', somewhat altering the original intention. The phrase 'would wish they were in the deserts' is translated in a fragmented manner, merging 'deserts' with 'bedouins', leading to confusion. Moreover, the nuanced meaning of seeking news 'from a far place' is missing, and 'fight but little' is oversimplified to 'لڑائی نہیں کریں گے', which incorrectly suggests complete inaction rather than minimal action. This affects both the tone and the specific meaning drawn from the original text. There are also grammatical errors observed in the translation like the use of 'علیہضب آئے' which does not match standard sentence structure in Urdu.",45
"The translation generally maintains the meaning of the original text but adjusts certain expressions which slightly alters the tone and specificity. For example, 'AlAhzab (the Confederates)' in the original is translated as 'کفار کے لشکر' (army of infidels), which might convey a different connotation. The original phrase 'Confederates' specifically refers to a certain historical group, and this nuance is somewhat lost in translation. Similarly, 'wandering among the bedouins' is translated to 'جا کر اپنی حالت کو دیکھیں' which shifts the focus from 'wandering' to observing their condition. Overall, the translation slightly alters meanings and tones but captures the main points.",78
"The translation captures the original meaning well, translating 'AlAhzab (the Confederates)' as 'لشکر' which is a suitable choice in the Urdu language for 'confederates' or an army of allies. The output retains the hypothetical scenarios described, accurately conveying the preference of the subjects to be away from the battlefield and avoiding direct confrontation ('یہ چاہیں گے کہ کاش ہم صحرا میں صحرائی عربوں کے ساتھ جا کر رہیں'). It also keeps the part about seeking news ('اور تمہاری خبریں دریافت کرتے رہیں') and fighting little if amid the described group ('اور اگر تمہارے ساتھ رہیں تو بھی بہت کم ہی لڑیں گے'), thus the translation is comprehensive, correct in grammar, and maintains the tone of concerned avoidance. There is a minor note on style; the term 'AlAhzad' could be directly transliterated to retain familiarity for readers who recognize the term specifically from religious texts, but this is minor and does not vastly impact the quality.",98
"The translated text accurately preserves the meaning of the original English text with no noticeable omissions or additions. It correctly conveys the request of the affluent to be excused, matching the tone and the religious injunction context. The Urdu translation uses appropriate terms like 'صاحبانِ استطاعت' for 'the affluent' and 'جہاد کرو' for 'strive (in His Way)', which are culturally and contextually suitable. Grammatically, the sentence structure in Urdu is correct, and the style is consistent with the style of religious texts in Urdu.",98
"The translated text generally conveys the meaning of the original text but has some issues. The phrase 'strive (in His Way)' in the original has been translated as 'محبت سے لڑو', which incorrectly implies 'fight with love' and deviates from the intended meaning of striving or fighting in the cause of God. Additionally, 'ask you to excuse them' is loosely translated to 'ہم کو اس لڑائی سے چھوڑ دو', which translates back to 'let us go from this fight', losing the nuance of asking for an excuse. The phrase 'Leave us with those who will sit back at home' has been translated accurately but could be better structured for clarity. There are no significant grammatical errors. Style and tone are generally maintained, though slight inaccuracies in word choice affect the precision of translation.",75
"The translation accurately conveys the message and details of the original text without adding or omitting any crucial parts. 'Believe in Allah and strive (in His Way) along with His Messenger' is well captured by 'الله پر ایمان لاؤ اور اس کے رسول کے ساتھ ہو کر جہاد کرو'. Furthermore, 'the affluent among them ask you to excuse them, saying: ""Leave us with those who will sit back at home.""' is translated correctly as 'ان میں سے دولت مندوں نے کہا کہ ہمیں چھوڑ دیجئے ان لوگوں کو جو بیٹھے رہنے والے ہیں'. The translation retains the directive and plaintive tone of the original text. There are no apparent grammatical errors in the Urdu translation.",95
"The translated text captures the meaning of the original efficiently without any omissions or distortive additions. The phrasing 'ان میں سے دولت مندوں کا ایک گروہ آپ سے عذر کرتا ہے' effectively translates 'the affluent among them ask you to excuse them', which retains both the specificity of the group being described (the affluent) and their action (asking for an excuse). The translation maintains the dual themes of religious faith and the reluctance of the affluent to join in striving along with the messenger, which was essential in the original. It also successfully retains the style and tone of the original text, which has a solemn and directive nature. There are no grammatical errors in the Urdu translation.",98
